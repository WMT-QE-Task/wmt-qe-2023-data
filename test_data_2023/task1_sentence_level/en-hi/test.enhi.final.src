Now so Reader class it is very similar to ‚ÄòInput Stream‚Äô class basically it basically read character by character and it has many methods those are basically useful for reading purpose only reading character by character ok, these are the different class we have already discussed about it is a basically listed in a tabular form you can check it ah but mainly we will discuss about
We can also get the same output by typing, sorted inside brackets marks comma reverse equal to True
Let us check and resolve it.
Now overall, the collection is as we told you that collection is a very vast thing, this is vast because it covers so many data structures in one bundle.
For example, whenever you want to add it, so adding go on adding list in this direction, so basically when you go for enqueue, so it is basically enqueue is equivalent to insert at end, if end is the end of the list actually.
so we will get the answer as 1 by 2 into pi.
All these methods basically facilitate actions like creating a particular key, associating key value and the object, searching/adding/removing a particular object when it's key is given and a lot more.

Now the map framework if we see the class hierarchy that is there, it has this class hierarchy there are number of interfaces defined in this framework, the interfaces are mentioned here namely map, sorted map and then navigable map those are the interfaces which basically have the design, any class you can design if you want to implement a particular interface.
A square is a polygon: The two classes here are square and polygon and the relationship between the square and polygon ‚ÄòIS A‚Äô or in other words, a polygon is the general class and the square is the special class.
But, anyway both the algorithms are comparable and it takes more or less same time and you can see that as the number of elements increases it does not increases exponentially as it is increases for the least over the search it is there.
Now, array we have already studied that array is supported ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ø means of different collections as we have already learned like arrays, array list, vector array and so many things are there even if in your program also you can define your own array.
On the other hand, there is a output restricted Dequeue as the name implies you are allowed to do insertion only at the rear end however you can do insertion deletion at the both end, so if you do so then it is called the output restricted Dequeue, right.
