Xinhua commentator : Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systemic engineering feat , Xi Jinping 's secretary-general speaks profoundly at the 20th Party Spiritual Seminar on Learning to Implement the Party <EOS>
Xinhua news agency Beijing , Feb. 11 Subject : Advancing Chinese-style modernization is a systemic engineering feat , Xi Jinping speaks at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of China <EOS>
Commentator from Xinhua <EOS>
Fostering Chinese-style modernization is a systemic endeavor that requires concerted , systematic planning , holistic advancement , and the proper handling of a number of important relationships , such as top-level design and practice exploration , strategy and strategy , integrity and innovation , efficiency and fairness , vitality and order , self-reliance and openness . <EOS>
At the opening session of the 20th General Spiritual Seminar on Implementing Xi Jinping 's Socialist Ideas and Party Spirituality in the New Era of China , where members , alternate members and key leadership cadres of provincial ministries studied to implement the ideas of socialism and the Party in a new era , the General Secretary of Xi , who scientifically grasped the laws and regulations of modern construction , systematically elaborated a series of important relations that need to be handled in practice , and provided a scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese modernization . <EOS>
The promotion of Chinese-style modernization involves economic , political , cultural , social , ecological civilization and other fields , relations between the ruling party and the military , domestic and foreign affairs , and defense . <EOS>
To carry out top-level design , it is necessary to have a deep insight into the dynamics of world development , to accurately grasp the common aspirations of the masses of people , and to explore the laws of economic and social development in depth , so that the planned and policy systems are timely , regular , creative , close-knit , up-and-down and coordinated . <EOS>
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory endeavor , and there are many unknown areas that need to be explored boldly in practice . <EOS>
Strategy is a fundamental issue for a political party and a country . <EOS>
To promote Chinese-style modernization , to enhance the forward-looking nature of the strategy to scientifically strategically predict the future , and to lead the next ; to strengthen the holistic nature and focus on solving the major problems that affect the party and the country 's cause . To improve the stability of strategy , once formed , it is necessary to persevere in the long term , grasp the bottom , do well . <EOS>
It is necessary to scientifically grasp the dialectical unified relationship between strategy and strategy , to combine the principled nature of strategy with the flexibility of the strategy in an organic way , and to master the strategic initiative in terms of flexible mobility , randomness , timing and decision-making . <EOS>
The Chinese people are a people of integrity and innovation . <EOS>
Dealing well with the relationship between conservation and innovation , both to safeguard the essence and source , the roots and soul of Chinese modernity , to adhere unwaveringly to the Chinese characteristics , essential requirements and major principles of China-style modernization , and to ensure the correct direction of modernisation in China , but also to place innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country , in accordance with modern development requirements , focusing on solving major theoretical and practical problems , actively recognizing changes and pressures , vigorously promoting reform and innovations , continuously shaping new development dynamics and new advantages , fully stimulating the creation of vitality for the whole society . <EOS>
Efficiency is an important foundation of fairness , and equity is a strong guarantee of efficiency . <EOS>

The U.S. upgrade of silicon chips is a major blow to the global semiconductor industry - Xinhua <EOS>
Recently , there has been an escalation in the U.S. war on Huawei 's chips , with the Netherlands and Japan , under pressure from the United States , agreeing to begin regulating the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China ; there have been reports in foreign media that the US government is considering cutting off all ties between American suppliers and Huawei and prohibiting American providers from supplying any products to Huawei ; the Biden administration is also preparing for the publication of an executive order to limit US investment in sensitive Chinese technology industry ... <EOS>
In recent years , the U.S. has continued to crack down on China 's development of silicon-based semiconductors , precisely suppressing the Chinese supply chain , and building an alliance to completely open up China in the advanced semconductor industry . <EOS>
Whether it is the establishment of a silicon technology alliance with South Korea , or the formation of the Quadripartite Alliance with the South Korean , Japanese and Chinese-Taiwanese regions for the production of chip chips , as well as the creation of semiconductor industry chains through the U.S.-Japan-Australia-China Quartet mechanism , the United States is trying to build a closed supply chain led by the US by means of politicization , militarisation and weaponisation , thus making up for its shortfall in chip manufacturing and maintaining its advantage in the global chip industry . <EOS>
However , the U.S. flag-waving tactical maneuver against China 's core has also paralyzed the enemy with a loss of 800,000 tons . <EOS>
Recently , PanLinx , a leading U.S. chip manufacturing equipment supplier , announced that it would lay off 1,300 full-time and 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters as a result of the latest round of a ban on the export of chip-making equipment to China . <EOS>
Global photolithography giant Asma Holdings , a Dutch company , recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor fabrication equipment to China could lead to higher prices . <EOS>
The U.S. government 's brutal crackdown on Chinese chip and semiconductor industries has hurt many American companies , including developers of electronic design automation tools , chip designers , manufacturers of wafer fabrication equipment , and chip makers themselves . <EOS>
The U.S. is supposedly pressuring China 's advanced semiconductor industry , but it is dragging down the global supply chain . <EOS>
The semiconductor industry is a high-technology and knowledge-intensive industry that has long formed a closely interconnected global chain . <EOS>
According to experts , the entire production process , based on specialized division of labor , of semiconductor products requires crossing national borders more than 70 times , reaching 100 days . <EOS>
Although the U.S. semiconductor industry has a strong base , it is weak in manufacturing capacity , especially in advanced process processes , and heavily reliant on East Asia . <EOS>
Even as the U.S. struggles to steer the advanced chip supply chains toward a US-dominated regional development , the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries is difficult to change . <EOS>
The U.S. is trying hard to reshape the semiconductor industry chain from China to cosmetics . <EOS>
Chips are at the heart of the global future industry , and the development of this industry depends on the participation of all countries in the world . <EOS>
In recent years , the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions , one after the other , to introduce the Huawei Innovation and Competition Act . The 2022 Huawei Chips and Science Act uses technology hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership . <EOS>
In the short term , the U.S. has indeed created problems for China 's chip industry and related industries and reaped real benefits . <EOS>
But in the long run , the US hysterical suppression and pushing back on China 's continuous breakthrough of the chip industry , losing the huge Chinese market , will ultimately greatly weaken the willingness and innovation capacity of US tech companies , damaging the development of global chip industries . <EOS>

Singapore tourism recovery strong , arrivals 19 times higher than in 2021 <EOS>
( Singapore ) The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that between 12 and 14 million international tourists are expected to visit Singapore in 2023 , generating between 18 and 21 billion new yuan in tourism revenues ; tourist arrivals and revenue will return to pre-COVID-19 levels of between 67 and 75 percent in 2019 ; and there is a high probability of a full recovery in the industry by 2024 . <EOS>
Singapore 's tourism market will gradually restart and recover in 2022 . <EOS>
According to the latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board , arrivals in 2022 have increased 19 times from 33.06 million in 2021 to 6.3 million , exceeding the earlier forecast of 4 to 6 million by Tourism Bureau , and visitors have recovered to pre-epidemic levels of 33 % . <EOS>
From January to September 2022 , Singapore 's tourism revenues totaled NS $ 8.96 billion and are projected to reach US $ 13.8 billion to 14.3 billion for the full year of 2022 . This is a six- to seven-fold increase from the NZ $ 1.89 billion in 2021 , which has returned to pre-COVID-19 levels of about 50 % to 52 % . <EOS>
The Singaporean government has taken many steps to accelerate the recovery of tourism . <EOS>
In April 2022 , the government announced the allocation of nearly 500 million yuan to stimulate the recovery of tourism . <EOS>
The tourism board recently announced that it plans to allocate $ 110 million from this budget over the next two years to launch more business and leisure activities to attract returning tourists . <EOS>
To make health and wellness one of Singapore 's tourism highlights , the Singapore Tourism Board has launched an intentional recruitment campaign on 23 November 2022 to develop a health spa on the southern coast of the country . <EOS>
In recent years , more and more tourists have put their health at the top of their list of considerations , said Wang Lingli , executive director of sports and wellness tourism at Singapore Tourism Authority . <EOS>
The development of a health and wellness attraction in Yangon 's Hainan district , which is home to the Hanging Bay Gardens and Hangzhou Dams , is expected to contribute to Singapore tourism and the economy , enabling tourists to spend and stay longer in Singapore . <EOS>
The team has won three championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) , two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) , two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) , two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) , two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) , two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) , two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) , two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) , two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) , two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) , two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) , two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) and two championships in the Egyptian Football League ( FIFA ) . <EOS>
The head of the Singapore Tourism Board , Chen Jianlong , said that in the coming years , healthy living will be an important part of Singapore 's tourism product . <EOS>
The coronavirus outbreak has raised public awareness and demand for physical and mental health . <EOS>
To this end , for the past two years , the tourism office has been promoting health and hygiene programs to the local public and international visitors . <EOS>
In June 2022 , the Singapore Tourism Board hosted the inaugural Health and Wellness Festival , offering more than 130 health activities and experiences to the public . <EOS>
Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences to tourists . <EOS>
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children 's Museum , the Avatar World at the Bay of Plenty Gardens , Central Beach Market in Sao Tome and Principe , a new exhibition hall in the Museum of Arts and Sciences to explore new areas of the city , and the open-air theater at Night Wildlife Park , Tourism will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Flying Bird Park at World of Wild Animals , making Singapore an attractive international travel destination . <EOS>
According to the plan , Singapore will develop relevant industry standards for conferences , exhibitions and awards for sustainable tourism by 2023 , with a focus on improving both waste management and carbon emissions to further optimize the tourist environment . <EOS>
The recovery in Singapore 's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry . <EOS>
Data shows that as of 18 December 2022 , passenger traffic at Changi Airport has recovered strongly , with up to 150,000 passengers a day and about 1 million a week , equivalent to about 75 % of the pre-COVID-19 level , and the number of employees in the airline industry has also returned to around 90 % of pre epidemic levels . <EOS>
The data shows that from January to October 2022 , Singapore welcomed 23.6 million passengers , up from 42 % before the coronavirus outbreak , and 170,000 takeoffs and landings , down from 53 % before . <EOS>
The rapid recovery in tourism has also driven the recovery of sectors such as accommodation , transport , catering and shopping . <EOS>
The Singapore government and the tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market . <EOS>
According to the assistant director of the Singapore Tourism Board 's International Division , Mr. Kurniawan , a survey of Chinese travel platforms shows that Singapore is ranked among the top three in the world in terms of safety index , which is one reason why it is so popular with Chinese tourists . <EOS>
Before the outbreak , about 3.6 million Chinese visited Singapore for holidays every year . <EOS>
With China 's easing of border policies , Chinese tourist arrivals are expected to recover from 30 % to 60 % in 2019 this year . <EOS>
In the future , the tourism agency will closely monitor the signals that China is releasing further on its outbound travel policy in response to changing tourist demands . <EOS>
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies , the Singapore Tourism Board will be actively preparing to welcome Chinese tourists in response to new trends in Chinese outbound travel . <EOS>
Looking ahead to the 2023 tourism market , the Singapore Tourism Authority is confident that the recovery of the tourist industry will be faster than expected as long as there is no significant recession in the global economy affecting public revenues and no new large-scale outbreaks of deadly epidemics . <EOS>
Relief from earthquake in Syria night after day <EOS>
Rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working day and night to rescue survivors buried under the rubble in the ruins of thousands of collapsed buildings since the devastating earthquake struck neighboring Turkey and Syria . <EOS>
In the freezing temperatures , they often call for silence , as they strive to hear any sound of life from the crumbling concrete piles . <EOS>

He said about 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals , while 1.05 million were displaced by the earthquake and crowded into makeshift shelters . <EOS>
With many people without food in the cold winter conditions , people are increasingly questioning the leaders of both countries ' response to the disaster . <EOS>
According to Syrian state media , President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma travelled to a hospital in Aleppo , reportedly for the first time since the earthquake . <EOS>
Earlier , the World Food Programme said it was running out of stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria as the state of war complicated relief efforts . <EOS>
Erdogan , who visited Turkey 's Adana province on Friday , acknowledged that the government response was not as fast as expected . <EOS>
The opposition has seized on the issue to attack Erdogan , who will run for re-election in the May 14 vote , but may be delayed due to the disaster . <EOS>
According to Reuters , anger over the delay in delivering aid and launching rescue operations could affect the election . <EOS>
Even before the earthquake , the vote was seen as the most serious challenge to Erdoƒüan 's two decades in power . <EOS>

EU summit debates refugee policy , EU officials : Acceptance process stalled step by step <EOS>
EU summit fights over refugee policy , EU officials : There are bottlenecks every step of the way <EOS>
At the latest EU summit of the day , EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said EU leaders had agreed to a stricter policy on illegal immigration , which would make it easier to deport illegal migrants , according to AFP news agency . <EOS>
The EU 's move is reportedly in response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe , where the core problem today is the small number of illegal migrants who are ultimately repatriated . <EOS>
According to the summit document , EU leaders called on the Commission to immediately mobilize large amounts of EU funds to strengthen the external borders through infrastructure and surveillance . <EOS>
However , the EU is in constant dispute with its member states over issues such as the payment of fence fees . <EOS>
In the meantime , he has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs . <EOS>
However , diplomatic officials from some member states said that if the EU could share parts of the installation of cameras , observation towers and other infrastructure along the external borders , this would help the country 's national budgets to speed up the construction process . <EOS>
EU officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process , limited capacity and the inability of member states ' immigration authorities to prevent refugees from filing a myriad of asylum applications in EU countries , and that the EU 's system is in near-permanent crisis mode , according to EURACTIV . <EOS>
According to the European Commission , the EU 's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year , almost half as many as the year before . <EOS>
Meanwhile , the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year . <EOS>
In this context , the summit also agreed on a guiding principle that EU countries can repatriate illegal migrants on the basis of a court ruling in another member state . <EOS>
In addition , EU leaders also agreed to increase the use of the concept of a security state , which would pave the way for the EU to develop a common list , the report said . <EOS>

The E-account of the hedge fund is closed : the Securities and Exchange Commission authorizes the development of all funds in the name of investors to be consolidated and consulted - Economic Observer Network - Professional financial news website <EOS>
Economic Observer Net Journalist Chen Yue said that the complexity of the fund 's purchasing channels makes it difficult to aggregate account information . <EOS>
Do you always forget your little treasure trove ? <EOS>
These problems of the Kisan people are about to be solved . <EOS>
On 10 February , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) announced the launch of an open test run of the E-Account APP in mobile app stores . <EOS>
It is reported that the E-accounting platform provides a one-stop-shop for private investors with information on publicly traded fund accounts and shares , aimed at solving the industry service pain points of many small and medium-sized investors who have forgotten their accounts . <EOS>
According to Wind data , as of the end of 2022 , there are a total of 156 public fund managers in the country , with a fund size of about 26 trillion yuan . <EOS>
The accounting systems of the participating registries are independent of each other and lack a unified industry inquiry channel . <EOS>
At the end of 2021 , there were more than 720 million fund investors in our country , which means that half of the country invested in fund products . <EOS>
Previously , investors had to inquire about purchases through different sales agencies , whereas with a hedge fund E-account , you can check all sales channels and have a clear view of the fund . <EOS>
What is an E-Account APP ? <EOS>
According to the relevant documents , the E-Account APP is a mobile application for the publicly traded fund industry , approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission of China for development and construction , which provides investors with a one-stop-shop inquiry about the holding of off-market shares in all market public fund products . <EOS>
Investors can easily and quickly control their holdings of the off-the-shelf shares of publicly traded fund products owned by the fund managers purchased through various sales channels throughout the market , improving the efficiency of queries . <EOS>
Specifically , the information that investors can query through the E-account of the hedge fund includes : information about the fund accounts opened with the managers of public funds in the market ; information on the trading accounts open at the public fund sales agencies ; and the out-of-the-box holdings of products such as publicly-traded investment funds ( PIFs ) and collective asset management schemes , which are not limited to 200 people . <EOS>
The Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center 's head of business , Liu Yiqiu , told Economic Observation Network reporters that investors can get a one-stop-shop information about all their out-of-the-box IPO fund holdings through the E-Account Coin App , which helps them find forgotten asset tokens , and more importantly , summarize the full account information of the integrated fund investment situation for clients , helping clients to gain a more timely , accurate and complete understanding of their own investments , thereby better optimizing their portfolio fund configuration and better planning their financial arrangements . <EOS>
How to register ? <EOS>
The reporter noted that at present , the E-Account APP has been launched in mobile app stores such as Huawei , Apple , Xiaomi , OPPO , Vivo , etc . , but the app is still in the open trial phase , registration requires filling out an invitation and investors can contact the fund manager who holds the funds to obtain it . <EOS>
A customer service representative of a large public fund in Shanghai gave a six-digit invitation code to a reporter from Economic Watch and told reporters that during the test phase of the app , China settlement provides a certain number of invitations to each fund manager , and investors come and get them , we will provide them . <EOS>
After the test run , the invitation code will no longer be used for open user registration . <EOS>
Oh , my God . <EOS>
According to the official website of the Securities and Exchange Commission , the journalists downloaded and used the relevant documents to register the account and complete the inquiry . The entire process took only a few minutes and was mainly divided into four steps : user registration , authentication of real name , binding the fund account , and public fund request . <EOS>
After this step of authentication , click on the button of binding the hedge fund , and all the fund products purchased by the journalist through the various fund sales platforms will be presented in the list of bundling options ( " binding accounts " ) . After completing this link , you can visually see the total assets of the invested fund and start using the query function . <EOS>
It is worth noting that the E-account is only a consultation service for investors and cannot be used for buying and selling . <EOS>
The data date displayed in the E-account tab generally moves the user 's query date ( T-day ) forward by three trading days . <EOS>
For example , if a hedge fund E-account is opened on February 10 , the total assets , fund shares , and net worth of the fund shown on the assets page correspond to the date pushed forward by three trading days to that date , which is February 7 . <EOS>

Buy at a discount ! <EOS>
Nanjing real estate market replicates the difference in price to compensate for the decline - China News Network <EOS>
In an interview with the Yangon Evening News / Violet News reporter on the 10th , it was discovered that the coupon agreement , which had not been seen for more than a decade , has returned to the Nanjing housing market . <EOS>
There are a lot of conditions in the price guarantee agreement . <EOS>
The property , located in Jiangxi 's New District , is called Boliyan Zhou Yuntai , and the landlord , Mr. Sun , told reporters that he found a brick declaring bricks when he was building it last weekend . <EOS>
The photographs he sent to reporters show that the developer of the property promised that anyone who purchased a property between February 1st and February 28th , from the date the parties signed the purchase and sale contract until the corresponding property was delivered , if the discount on the other properties in the project was greater than the one previously enjoyed ( " limited to other unsold commercial houses belonging to the same house , building block , unit , or type of property ) , he could exchange the house for the buyer and refund the difference " . <EOS>
According to Mr. Sun , the housing consultant said that this is actually a price-guarantee agreement , with the aim of making the buyer reassured , without having to worry about the development enterprise price reduction promotion . <EOS>
There are also many buyers who believe that the coupon price agreement is not a bad thing , although it gives the buyer a certain amount of money . <EOS>
Ms. Liu , who intends to buy a new house in Jiangsu Province , said that the insured property is first of all the same type of house , also has to be on the Same floor , same unit , the buyer can compare the price of the property , so the mortgage threshold is still very high . <EOS>
There are also home buyers who believe that because of the asymmetry of information , it is not excluded to give additional concessions when selling , which makes it difficult for the buyer to maintain their rights . <EOS>
Will the buyers be able to stay ? <EOS>
Reporters in Nanjing found out that the property was sold in November last year for a total of 252 units in the top two floors , with a floor area of 105 m2 , 114 m2 and 129 m2 . <EOS>
However , over the past two months , online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the complex is currently 157 units , accounting for 62.3 % , of which 128 units are for the 8th , 113 units for 7th and 44 out of the 124 units . <EOS>
According to marketers , the price-guarantee bubble also appeared in Nanjing in 2008 . <EOS>
In August of that year , in order to attract the attention of buyers , the property in Yokohama West Huang Mountain Road launched a coupon insurance plan , which specifically promised the company that if the project was extended within a year the difference would be returned to the old owner . <EOS>
Since then , in April 2011 , nine other properties in Nanjing have pledged to pay the difference in price . <EOS>
The rooftop market is warming up , and the need for a needle and a tonic is even greater . <EOS>
Mr. Shen , a senior operator in the real estate industry in Nanjing , said that the price-guarantee agreement is also one of the marketing methods used by the company . <EOS>
He believes that today developers need more confidence than home buyers , and that the introduction of price-fixing agreements is actually giving them a boost . <EOS>
As for whether buyers can stay , he said it depends on the impact of regulatory policies , lending thresholds and many other factors , and remains to be seen . <EOS>
Google 's AI chatbot is answering the wrong question , and the stock price of its parent company has evaporated to $ 100 billion . <EOS>
I 'm not sure what to do . <EOS>
Google 's newly-launched AI chatbot , Bard , has been disadvantaged by the mis-answered questions in its promotional short films , causing Google parent company Alphabet to plummet by 8.9 % on Wednesday , falling below the $ 100 mark , with a market cap that has evaporated to $ 110 billion ( around RM47.65 billion ) and $ 94.57 as of Friday close . <EOS>
The market is worried that Alphabet will not be able to compete with Microsoft . <EOS>
According to a Reuters report , Google earlier posted a short promotional video on social media for the AI chatbot Bard , in which someone asked Bard : " Hey , can I tell my nine-year-old what new discoveries I 've made about the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) ? " <EOS>
In response , Bard mentioned that the telescope had taken the first photograph of an exoplanet . <EOS>
However , according to NASA data , the first image of an exoplanet was taken by the European Southern Observatory 's Hubble Space Telescope in 2004 . <EOS>
Reuters also reported that Alphabet shares plummeted after Bard 's answer was incorrect . <EOS>
Google , on the other hand , notes that Bard 's feedback loop highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process that combines external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure Bard responds to a high standard of feedback based on quality , security , and truthful information . <EOS>

Multiple data recession Taiwan 's economy starts the year poorly - Xinhua <EOS>
Xinhua Taipei , Feb. 11 ( Xinhua ) -- Taiwan 's export trade volume has plummeted five times , the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index ( PMI ) has shrunk for the seventh consecutive month , and the consumer price index ( CPI ) is in third place ... Recently , Taiwan authorities have released economic data for January 2023 . <EOS>
According to analysts , Taiwan 's economy started the year off poorly and is under a lot of growth pressure . <EOS>
According to the Department of Finance , Taiwan 's exports in January were $ 31.51 billion , down 21.2 % year on year for the fifth consecutive month . <EOS>
Exports of 11 major export categories declined in comparison to the same period last year . <EOS>
Plastic and its derivatives and optical devices suffered the biggest declines , falling by 37.6 % and 35.7 % respectively . <EOS>
Electronic parts exports decreased by 20.1 % year on year , the largest decrease in 11 years . <EOS>
Among them , integrated circuits decreased by 18.3 % per year , the biggest decline in 14 years . <EOS>
According to the department 's head of statistics , Yumena , this shows that the effects of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry are spreading and the industry is entering a period of correction . <EOS>
Statistics show that Taiwan 's imports and exports doubled in January , with a surplus of only US $ 2.34 billion , the lowest level in nearly three years . <EOS>
Taiwanese authorities ' finance department believes that global demand for terminals is declining , industrial inventory adjustments are holding back manufacturers ' willingness to buy , export growth is unlikely to improve in the short term , and Taiwan 's exports are likely to decline higher than expected in Q1 of this year . <EOS>
The Taiwan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index ( PMI ) was 40.4 % seasonally adjusted in January , falling 3.3 percentage points from December last year , a seven-month consecutive contraction , according to the China Institute of Economics in Taiwan . <EOS>
In the system of economic monitoring indicators , the PMI is a dry line at 50 % and an index greater than 50 % represents an expansion of the economy and a contraction . <EOS>
Among the five indicators that make up the January Taiwan PMI , new orders , contraction in production and employment , decreased delivery times for suppliers , and shrinking inventories . <EOS>
The total number of industries reporting PMI contraction is 35.1 % , followed by electron microscopy ( 35.2 % ) , chemicals ( 39.2 % ) and medical technologies ( 45.7 % ) , basic raw materials ( 42.4 % ) , transportation industry ( 46.6 % ) , and food textiles ( 44.7 % ) . <EOS>
In terms of prices , the CPI for Taiwan rose by 3.04 % in January , breaking the 3 % mark since July last year . <EOS>
Among them , vegetable prices soared 28.25 % to a new 17-month high . <EOS>
The CPI in January and February should be close to the 2.71 percent average in December last year , and inflation pressures are still present and still high . <EOS>
Looking ahead to this year 's Taiwanese economy , experts are pessimistic about reports in the island media , such as the Daily Mail , Yahoo Financial , and others . <EOS>
Liu Daing , a professor at the Faculty of Economics at Taipei Central University , said that a recession in exports could cause cash flow problems for export manufacturers and increase the risk of debt default . <EOS>
At the same time , the decrease in orders causes manufacturers to cut human costs , affecting the labor market and the household economy , which in turn affects their purchasing power . <EOS>
A researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research , Liu Dajun , believes that inflation in the US and Europe is unresolved this year , demand continues to shrink , and Taiwan 's export slump is expected to continue into the first half of the year . <EOS>
As Taiwan 's economy relies heavily on exports and has been hit by a slump in imports , full-year economic growth will be lower than last year . <EOS>
Suzuki founder Liu Yongkang , who led China 's first clothing transformation , has died of a sudden heart attack . <EOS>
On February 11th , a public statement was published on the WeChat account of the certified entity , Cygwin Holdings Limited ( hereinafter referred to as " Cygwigan Holding Co . Ltd " . ) , stating that the founder , Chairman and CEO of Cigwagan , Liu Yongkang , died on February 10 , 2023 , at the age of 65 , due to sudden cardiac arrest . <EOS>
In the 1980s , Liu Yong worked as a factory manager for a state-owned cotton mill , and in 1989 he became the head of the former Ningbo Yunfeng Garment Plant , a subsidiary of Sushi . <EOS>
In December 2022 , at the 22nd China Enterprise Future Stars Annual Meeting of the 20th Chinese Business Leaders Conference , Liu Yongkang said in a speech that in the 1990s , the market share of cedar brands in China 's lingerie market was as high as 37 % . <EOS>
In 1996 , Cedar Shares ( ( 600884.SH ) went public , becoming the first listed company in China 's clothing industry . <EOS>
Just as the clothing business was in full swing , the Sushi Group began to transform , because Liu Yong realized that once the market was opened , Chinese brands would naturally form a ladder brand market . <EOS>
In 1999 , Sugisugi started studying corporate transformation , and Yang Yongkang recalled that year : " We came to Shanghai to find out what exactly to do with the transition . We found a lot of expert scholars and held a series of meetings and workshops " . <EOS>
Finally , we have set two big strategic directions . <EOS>
The first direction is new energy and new materials , and the other is great health with a future . <EOS>
After the strategic direction was determined , Sug Sug began to look for cooperation . At that time , the Carbon Institute , which was supported by the Busan Thermal Energy Institute for silicon steel , was working on the national 863 topic , and scientific research funding was not enough , so Sugu Sug and the CFC Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the country 's 863-topical aluminum intermediate phase carbon microspheres project , engaged in the research and development , production and sales of negative polar materials , to achieve the commercial promotion of positive polar material in China . <EOS>
In 2001 , the company achieved large-scale production of intermediate-phase carbon nanotubes and began domestic substitution , replacing Japan as the main domestic supplier . <EOS>
It is China 's first Lithium-ion battery negative material production enterprise , which has achieved the nationalization of lithium ion batteries negative materials . <EOS>
With the rapid popularization of lithium batteries , Sage began to develop gradually , and in 2007 the Lithium Electrolytic Materials business was incorporated into the main business of Sase , while the revenue share of the clothing business decreased from year to year , until 2013 . <EOS>
In February 2021 , the company successfully acquired LG Chemical 's film business , entered the LCD film market , and founded the film company Suge Gold Electric , which has a relatively high technology content in this field . The main competitors of Sage are the top 500 companies in the world , such as Samsung of South Korea , Xiaomi of Japan , JD Electronics . <EOS>
Liu Yong has just shared his thoughts on post-investment management : Why do private Chinese companies acquire some high-tech companies internationally , and why are those acquisitions unlikely to succeed ? <EOS>
Because everyone will consider that I spent so much money , I have to send someone to take care of it , this is an action that is normally done . Well , however , Yang Yongkang is different , the day the acquisition of Sug Sug succeeds , he just announced to Sugkin Light Electric that Suggin is the largest shareholder , and decided to implement a one-two system . <EOS>
According to the negative polarity data released by the ICC in 2022 , the shipping volume of cypress pine in 2022 will exceed 200,000 tons , an increase of 100 % year-on-year , with a market share of 16 % , and the shipment of synthetic graphite is at the top of the list . <EOS>
In terms of the optical film business , Yano Research statistics show that the company 's pineapple optics will have a global market share of 29 % in 2022 and is expected to reach 32 % in 2023 , continuing to rank first in the world . <EOS>

On February 9 , the company said on its interactive platform that at the end of 2022 , it had an effective graphite production capacity of about 100,000 tons . <EOS>
According to the report , Wang is still the chairman and controlling shareholder of the company . <EOS>
An eye-popping survey showed that Liu Yong held a 40.1 % stake in the company . <EOS>
Li Chihua , born in 1968 , is the general manager of Suzhou Battery Materials Co . , Ltd. in Dongguan , the chairman of the board of directors of Ningbo Zucchini New Material Technology Co . Ltd . , and the vice-president of Hunan Zuzhou Energy Technology Company . <EOS>
On February 10th , in an investor interactive platform , Cedar Shares said that the company 's senior executives are not related to the person who actually controls it . <EOS>

Hackers supporting protests hijack Iranian president 's televised speech to mark revolution anniversary <EOS>
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution , but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised speech by President Ibrahim Raisi . <EOS>
The president 's live televised speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute with a sign of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers , whose name is Edilat Ali ( Ali Justice ) , appearing on screen . <EOS>
Another voice shouted " Death to the Islamic Republic " . <EOS>
According to a Reuters report today , hackers disrupted state television reports on the anniversary of Iran 's revolution . <EOS>
Iranian officials mark the 44th anniversary of Iran 's revolution , and the hardline government of Raisi faces the most audacious challenge yet from young protesters demanding their removal from power . <EOS>
Following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country 's moral police in September , nationwide protests continued to sweep Iran . <EOS>
A deadly crackdown on protests by Iranian security forces is one of the biggest challenges facing the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution that toppled the 2,500-year-old monarchy . <EOS>
As part of an amnesty to commemorate the anniversary of the revolution , the Iranian authorities on Friday released imprisoned dissidents Fahad Mesami and Faridabad Adelha , an Iran-French scholar , who had been detained during a hunger strike . <EOS>
Earlier , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty for some prisoners arrested in recent anti-government protests . <EOS>
According to HRANA , as of Friday , 528 protesters have been killed , including 71 minors . <EOS>
According to reports , 70 other government security personnel have been killed . <EOS>
Up to 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested . <EOS>
For weeks , Iranian leaders and state media have been calling for a vote at Saturday 's rally to express opposition to the protests and support for the government . <EOS>
On the eve of the anniversary of Iran 's revolution on Friday night , state media showed fireworks as part of a government-sponsored celebration , with people chanting " Allahu Akbar ! " <EOS>
( God is the greatest ! <EOS>
I 'm not sure . <EOS>
However , many in the rally could also be heard shouting " Death to the dictator ! " <EOS>
In a video posted on social media , the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran , Hassan Rouhani , said : <EOS>
On Saturday , state television broadcast live footage of official rallies in various states across the country . <EOS>
In Tehran , as part of the official celebrations , domestic anti-ballistic missiles , drones , antisubmarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed . <EOS>
President Lacey 's speeches are often interrupted by the slogan " Fuck America to death " which is a signature slogan at state rallies . <EOS>
The crowd continued to shout , " Death to Israel " . <EOS>
Adelkhah , who has been in prison since 2019 , is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran , Reuters said , a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months . <EOS>
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on national security charges . <EOS>
They later placed her under house arrest , but she returned to prison in January . <EOS>
Adelkhah has denied the allegations . <EOS>
A week before Mesami 's release , supporters warned that he was at risk of death as a result of the hunger strike . <EOS>
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting the compulsory wearing of the headscarf . <EOS>
The French Foreign Ministry responded to Adelkhah 's release on Friday , calling for her freedom to be restored , including being allowed to return to France if she wishes . <EOS>
Oh , my God . <EOS>
Did the balloon incident brighten America 's eyes ? <EOS>
Strengthening restrictions on technology exports to China <EOS>
According to the Wall Street Journal today , the United States is preparing to further tighten its technology exports to China after the balloon incident . <EOS>
Current and former security officials said the balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and sought more political support for strengthening U.S. technological protection . <EOS>
The U.S. says the balloon carries antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication . <EOS>
According to Martijn Rasser , a former senior CIA official who now works at the Washington think tank 's Center for a New American Security . <EOS>
This is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire , supporting the views of the Chinese hardliners . <EOS>
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that " we will also consider taking broader action to expose and respond to China 's larger-scale surveillance activities , which pose a threat to our national security as well as our allies and partners " . <EOS>
U.S. officials say they have notified the governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident , and international coordination is critical to responding to the Chinese threat . <EOS>
Emily Benso , a senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Strategy and International Affairs , said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration , the US House of Representatives ' newly-established Task Force on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party may also be pressuring the United States to take tougher measures to slow China 's development . <EOS>
She said lawmakers will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance , which in turn could force the White House to adopt a harder policy . <EOS>
According to the Wall Street Journal , many advocates of tighter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of regulation to include industries such as artificial intelligence . <EOS>
The U.S. government is also in the process of developing a foreign investment review program that examines whether there are potential national security threats from China to American investments abroad . <EOS>
Analysts say the White House may face calls for the plan to be rolled out sooner . <EOS>
Law unions once again mobilize anti-government rally for pension reform <EOS>
On Saturday ( February 11 ) , the French trade unions once again launched a nationwide mobilization against the government 's draft pension reform , calling on people to take to the streets and express their views . <EOS>
This is the fourth day of the social movement against the government 's draft pension reforms . <EOS>
The number of people who responded to the call for rallies may influence the next action plan of the trade union group . <EOS>
This is the fourth time in a month that France 's eight largest trade union groups have jointly launched a nationwide mobilization , and the first time that a protest rally has been scheduled for Saturday . <EOS>
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people and they don 't have to choose between a demonstration or a pay strike , trade union groups hope that today 's rally will attract more participation . <EOS>
The unions of the subway and the public railway companies today did not call for a strike , the bus system should work normally , citizens can travel by car to the meeting place , and in areas where schools have started their winter holidays , people can start their normal vacation . <EOS>
Trade union groups are hoping for more than a million people to attend the rally today , while police are expecting between 600,000 and 800,000 nationwide and 90,000 to 120,000 in the Paris metropolitan area . <EOS>
Since the start of the anti-government protests against pension reforms , the number of people actually taking to the streets to take part in the march has decreased , although polls show that a majority of French people do not support the move to lower the statutory retirement age from the current 62 to 64 . <EOS>
The first strike demonstration on January 31 brought together between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people across the country . <EOS>
Meanwhile , the number of demonstrators on Tuesday ( February 7 ) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million across the country . <EOS>
The pension reform is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly . <EOS>
A number of amendments were submitted by opposition groups , especially those led by the radical left , so that the consideration process moved very slowly . <EOS>
In the meantime , the dispute between the two sides has become increasingly acute . <EOS>
A member of France 's far-left Party of Invincibility recently posted a photo on social media of himself walking on a balloon with the head of the Minister of Labour on it , sparking protests from the ruling party . <EOS>
The president of the National Assembly finally announced a 15-day ban on the MP from parliamentary activities as a punishment for his behavior . <EOS>
Despite the reforms , which have sparked the biggest social upheaval in France in more than two decades , the government has so far made no major concessions , albeit with some adjustments to the draft . <EOS>
The unions are preparing to launch another protest on Thursday , March 16 , when the draft reform bill will be sent to the Senate for discussion . <EOS>

The first personal pension products go on sale <EOS>
There are seven products available , with a minimum of 360 days . <EOS>
Personal pension products are finally online . <EOS>
On February 10 , the China Financial Network published the first list of personal pension products , with the official launch of seven personal retirement products from Banking Finance , Farmers Bank Finance and China Post Finance . <EOS>

According to the Beijing Youth Daily , four of the five newly developed products are all fixed-income products , with a shorter holding period of 365 days , 540 days and 720 days respectively , and an annualized performance of 3.70 percent - 4.20 percent , 4.10 percent-4.60 percent and 4.40 percent to 4.90 and 5.25 to 5.75 percent . <EOS>

The sale of the first personal pension fund products marks the official opening of personal retirement fund accounts for private pension investors . <EOS>
In November last year , the Banking Supervisory Board ( BSC ) adopted a temporary measure to manage the personal pension business of Commercial Banks and Financial Companies . <EOS>
The scheme allows participants to purchase personal retirement savings , personal pension management products , individual pension insurance products and products of the Personal Pension Public Fund through their Personal Pensions Fund Account . <EOS>

Previously , the banks participating in the pilot only offered three types of products : individual retirement savings , individual pension insurance products and individual public pension funds . <EOS>
Now that personal pension funds are also concentrating , how should investors choose ? <EOS>
According to experts from the R & D department of the Bank , both the pilot and the individual pension products have three characteristics when compared to other personal pensions products . <EOS>
The first is stability , better risk management mechanisms , more robust investment strategies and concepts , and the implementation of independent third-party custody outside the parent bank . <EOS>
The second is the long-term , in the pilot phase , the term of pension funds is 5 years or more , and the next phase of the individual pension fund , with a minimum holding period of one year in principle , is encouraged to hold more than three years . <EOS>
The third is accessibility , the product purchase threshold is low and the starting point is usually 1 yuan , some are as low as 0.01 yuan . <EOS>
Experts point out that investors should make choices based on product characteristics and their own risk tolerance . <EOS>
Individual pension savings have the characteristics of a longer term , higher interest rate , high security , and are suitable for people with low risk tolerance ; personal pension insurance products are more secured and better suited to people who cannot afford investment risks and can accept stable returns ; while individual pension management products and public fund products do not guarantee either the cost or the return , have a certain investment risk , but the expected return is higher , are appropriate for those with certain financial knowledge and a higher ability to take risks . <EOS>

Meizu reaches defense consensus against Chinese Communist Party <EOS>
On February 9 , Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and held talks with Prime Minister Kirishima Wencheng . <EOS>
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing China 's encroachment on the South China Sea and the East Sea , and after the meeting , the leaders of the Philippines issued a joint statement saying that they would conduct substantive defense exchanges through the signing of a trilateral defence agreement with the United States to oppose the Chinese hegemonic policy . <EOS>

According to the website of the Ministry of Emergency Management , on February 10 , the Chinese rescue team , which is searching and rescuing people in Turkey , dispatched three operational detachments , 45 rescuer personnel , and one trapped person . <EOS>
At the same time , two search and evaluation teams were dispatched to evaluate 15 buildings on Wodabash Street . <EOS>
So far , the rescue of four trapped people , search for five victims , life signs and risk assessment of 25 collapsed buildings have been carried out . <EOS>
The rescue team will continue to carry out in-depth relief work by scientifically adjusting the relief force according to the actual situation in the disaster area and the situation on the ground . <EOS>
The rescue team receives information from various channels , such as embassies , local governments , UNRWA , and verifies it through online enquiries , on-site searches , etc . <EOS>
The Chinese Hong Kong Rescue Team was briefed on the current situation of the rescue environment and building collapses , and jointly carried out the search operation . <EOS>
He is currently in charge of regional coordination ( SSC5 ) with the Italian rescue team , and has sent three team members to Regional Rescue Coordination Center 5 , where he has been in contact with several teams from Italy , the United Kingdom , Serbia , Slovakia , Oman and other countries . <EOS>
The rescue team continues to strengthen the safety management and security of the team , in accordance with the principle of unified command , safety first , strengthening safety control at the scene , reinforcing the disciplinary requirements of relief work , and clarifying safety precautions . <EOS>

Chongyang asks what he thinks about the U.S. non-farm employment data in January : over-expectations and future trends - Economic Watch Network - Professional financial news website <EOS>
Q : How do you see the January non-farm employment data in the US going beyond expectations and future trends ? <EOS>
A : The U.S. Department of Labor released January 2023 data on nonfarm employment , adding 517,000 new jobs , well above the 189,000 expected by the market ; the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4 % , its lowest level in nearly 50 years ; hourly wage growth was 4.4 % , relative to the rest of the world , 0.3 % , slightly slower . <EOS>
Overall , there are a number of one-off and technical disruptions to this data , such as teachers returning from strikes , corrections to survey statistics , updates to the seasonal adjustment factor , which may be corrected in the future ( reference : January 2022 increase in non-farmers from 5.04 million to 36.4 million ) , or nonfarm employment is not as strong as the data shows ) . <EOS>
Structurally , the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies remains , but at a low level ; new jobs in highly exposed services such as leisure hotels , education and healthcare have recovered significantly , and data show that the labor gap in the services sector remains . <EOS>
Combined with similarly higher-than-expected service PMI , recoveries in job vacancies and labor shortages , and stronger consumer credit data , we assess a rapid recovery in the U.S. service industry after extreme weather and holidays . <EOS>
We believe that the supply-demand tensions in the US job market are unlikely to improve without a recession . <EOS>
Currently , there are more than 5 million labor gaps in the U.S. labor market , and labor participation rates are slowly rising , especially among those aged 25-54 who are nearing pre-epidemic highs . <EOS>
In addition , stronger consumer demand will further delay the impact of austerity on the job market due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit among U.S. residents . <EOS>
Continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the bedrock of America 's economy in 2023 . <EOS>
Overlapping is nearing the end of interest rate hikes , inflation expectations are recurring , and we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth . <EOS>

Prior to the release of the data , the US equity and bond markets were overly optimistic about the Fed 's rate hike path . <EOS>
With inflation data continuing to improve , while the Fed continues to shorten the pace of rate hikes while maintaining the fragile balance of the market 's expectations , the markets are turning a blind eye to the biased rhetoric by the Federal Reserve , which not only expects to stop raising rates early , but also to expect two rate cuts at the end of this year . <EOS>
In the context of tight labour market supply and demand and the uncertain impact of austerity policies , we believe that the Fed 's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable , and that extreme market expectations of adjustment and trade congestion will cause some damage to the market . <EOS>
Nevertheless , the persistence of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation , with the year-on-year turnaround of M2 data and the gradual improvement of the leading indicators of various CPI scores , since October the US CFI data has moved to a rapidly declining phase , while the persistent growth of wages will only serve as a basis for future Inflation data . <EOS>
Deputy Chairman of the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) Sheri Liang conveyed the slogan : " Welcome to Green Camp Land under the 1992 consensus " <EOS>
Taiwan 's Chinese Nationalist Party ( CCP ) Vice Chairman , Shao Liqiang , has met with Taiwanese National Bureau Director Liu He and the CPC Central Political Bureau Permanent Commissioner , Wang Yi-ning , during his visit . <EOS>
Liu Chunsan , a senior adviser to the National Policy Foundation , an official party body of the Kuomintang , was interviewed by the Central News Agency of Taiwan last night and positively evaluated Liu 's remarks that China welcomes Green Party members to visit the mainland as long as they agree with Liu in the 92nd Consensus and oppose Taiwan . <EOS>
The comments from the Nationalist Party were seen as something new . <EOS>
However , this is not mentioned in the news of the day . <EOS>
The ruling People 's Democratic Party ( PDP ) in Taiwan has repeatedly clarified its refusal to accept the 1992 consensus . <EOS>
According to the Central News Agency today , the vice chairman of the Nationalist Party , Xi Jinping , visited the country during his visit to Beijing , where he met with Wang Yi-ning , permanent commissioner of China 's Central Political Bureau , and Yang Yi , director of Beijing ' s new State Administration , respectively . <EOS>
In an interview with Liu , Shao Liqiang said that the political basis of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) is the 92 consensus against Taiwan , while Liu Chunsan , senior advisor to the National Political Foundation ( NPC ) , said in the meeting that it is a raw-juice concoction . <EOS>
This is different from the previous conferences in which I have participated . <EOS>
The recent video conference with the Continental Journal , and this one , did not hear Taiwanese scholars talk about martial arts and anti-secessionism , but instead about the resumption of exchanges and dialogue . <EOS>
Liu Chun-shan pointed out that the two sides are at risk of a bloody war and that mainland China hopes to communicate its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang . <EOS>
Since there is no mutual trust between the people and the communists , the other side is still willing to do good work for the Taiwanese and does not want to ruin relations on both sides . <EOS>
According to Liu Chun-shan , Wang Li-ning also personally instructed Liu to talk to them about their demands ( Taiwanese farmers and fishermen ) , that you must implement them , and that if you can 't solve the case , you should take it on a case-by-case basis . <EOS>
The report did not mention whether the KMT visitor to the mainland directly mentioned the daily disruption caused by Chinese warships , the problem of farmers and fishermen in Taiwan 's minority counties , or whether a reporter interviewed by the Central News Agency asked such questions . <EOS>
Fitness industry needs to get out of crisis of trust - Xinhua <EOS>
Another big gym with a thunderstorm ? <EOS>
Recently , the issue of the rights of members of well-known gyms has attracted public attention . <EOS>
After the Spring Festival , many members found that their stores were not functioning normally , and then the rumors about the collapse of the runway caused panic among the members , leading to the intervention of public security and social services . <EOS>
Finally , the relevant officials of the institution responded by promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of their employees and members until the wind died down . <EOS>
Some of the stores of individual gyms are experiencing operational problems , temporary closures , and consumers should be calm and waiting for the problem to be solved . <EOS>
Behind the fitness club member advocacy is a deep-seated crisis of confidence in the industry . <EOS>
Traditional gyms in the country generally adopt a pre-paid model , and the underlying logic behind their development is that users don 't get paid . <EOS>
With cash flow from pre-sale membership cards and the continuous opening of new stores , it seems to be able to cycle back and forth , but in reality it is not possible to form a stable profit model . <EOS>
Negative information about industries such as gyms and runways is frequently reported , causing a strong shock to consumer confidence . <EOS>
In terms of market prospects , gyms are certainly a lucrative business . <EOS>
The gymnasium , despite its ups and downs , has always been the focus of capital . <EOS>
Several data shows that the market continues to warm up , with the heat rising in areas such as textile consumption . <EOS>
Specifically to the fitness market , as the standard of living of residents steadily improves , the concept of healthy living is deeply ingrained in people 's hearts . <EOS>
The better the situation , the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development . <EOS>
However , the individual agencies , blindly optimistic about the recovery of the fitness market after the crisis , have sounded the horn of opening up the country and invested a brain of financing in the construction of new stores . <EOS>
It is undeniable that in recent years , many institutions have withdrawn from the epidemic , the industry has been rechartered , and strong companies have been selectively increasing their acquisition efforts , repositioning , which is not a new opportunity . <EOS>
However , in order for the fitness market to develop into a virtuous cycle and move steadily along Kangzhou Avenue , the industry must change the traditional model and change its business strategy . <EOS>
It is only by staying strong and rebuilding consumer confidence and security that we can truly win the market and the future . <EOS>
Compared to building new stores to grab the market , the fitness industry currently needs more to focus on optimizing services , with high-quality development to stabilize users . <EOS>
First of all , it is the service that keeps users . <EOS>
The gym belongs to the service industry , whose essence is to adhere to a user-oriented approach , closely around the needs of users , focusing on the improvement of service quality . <EOS>
Secondly , digital transformation will improve the user experience . <EOS>
For example , the current popular internet gym model allows users to pay for and choose their own venue . <EOS>
At the same time , body data and movement data can be used effectively to meet social needs , enabling a complete service loop from online to offline . <EOS>
With no private sales , no huge annual passes , users ' worries about the gym 's run-ins with the law are reduced , and trust is enhanced . <EOS>
In addition , it is important to actively explore the multi-industry model . <EOS>
Nowadays , sports consumption has moved from single-service to scene consumption , and fitness clubs are expected to become the new entry point for consumption and surrounding products such as sports supplements and gym equipment that are needed for fitness or will become new perks , providing consumers with a richer choice . <EOS>

The Biden administration on Friday ( February 10 ) blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the espionage balloon program . <EOS>
The U.S. Department of Commerce says the five Chinese companies and one research institute help modernize the Chinese military , especially its aerospace program , which includes shuttles and planes . <EOS>
Blacklisted companies find it difficult to access technology exports to the United States . <EOS>
The list is known as the Entity List , and companies on the list will not be able to purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the Department of Commerce . <EOS>
The companies included in the blacklist are : Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co . , Ltd . , China Electronics Technology Group 's 48th Research Institute , Dongguan Ling Air Remote Sensing Technology Company , Xiamen Aircraft Technologies Group Limited , Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Air Technology Corporation and Shaanxi Xian Air Force Technologies Company Limited . <EOS>
In the meantime , the White House has said it is considering broader measures to expose and address larger-scale surveillance activities by China that threaten U.S. national security . <EOS>
The balloon incident sparked further tensions between China and the United States , and U.S. Secretary of State Blinken canceled a trip to China . <EOS>
The U.S. dropped the balloon on February 4 , and the Chinese government offered serious engagement to the American Embassy in China , criticizing the United States for its severe shock and undermining the efforts and processes of both sides to stabilize Sino-American relations . <EOS>
Based on the available evidence of the wreckage and information from the Chinese military 's procurement platform , the U.S. government concluded that the balloon manufacturer had direct ties to the PLA and was a supplier approved by the military . <EOS>
In a press conference on Friday , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Zedong said that China had repeatedly explained and clarified its position regarding the accidental entry of a Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle into US airspace due to irresistible force . <EOS>
According to the State Department 's website , she added that the relevant resolutions of the US Congress are purely political manipulation and hype . <EOS>
The Chinese side strongly disagrees and firmly opposes this move . <EOS>
Matthew Axelrod , Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce , said : " Today 's action demonstrates our collective efforts to identify and prevent China from using espionage balloons that violate the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries " . <EOS>
Oh , my God . <EOS>
According to Reuters , an employee of Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co . , Ltd. in Guangzhou said he was unaware of the sanctions and declined further comment . <EOS>
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet commented on the information . <EOS>

On the morning of February 11 , during a visit to Brunei Darussalam , Vietnamese Prime Minister Fan Ming-ying and his wife visited the University of Bruges ( UBD ) . <EOS>
The University of Brunei is the largest centre of higher education and scientific research in the country , ranking third in regional university rankings . <EOS>
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of Vietnam 's cooperation in education and training . <EOS>
Brunei University formally established a partnership with FPT University of Vietnam in July 2013 , with the main area of cooperation being English language training . <EOS>
In addition to foreign languages such as English , French , German , Japanese and Korean , Brunei University also incorporates Vietnamese into its curriculum . <EOS>
During the visit to the University of Brunei , the Prime Minister of the Government of Vietnam , Ms. Fan Minh Diem , spoke with students from Vietnamese language classes . <EOS>
Prime Minister Fan Minh Di·ªám is pleased that more and more foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese , thereby making a positive contribution to promoting the cultural characteristics of Vietnam and the image of the local people around the world . <EOS>
Government Prime Minister Fan Minh Diem expressed his belief and hope that the Vietnamese language faculty at Brunei University will be stronger ; that its students will become more interested in the language , work hard to learn it , be able to use it fluently at an early age , and become ambassadors of friendly cooperation between the two countries . <EOS>
On the occasion , Prime Minister Fan Minh Diem also interacted via video with Vietnamese students studying English at FPT-UBD Global Centre in Phnom Penh to learn about their learning , especially during the pandemic . <EOS>
The cooperation between FPT University and the University of Brunei , and in particular the Global Centre of FPT-UBD , is a vibrant symbol of the educational partnership between the two countries . <EOS>
At the same time , I hope that the students of the center will make greater progress in their studies and make a positive contribution to the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries . <EOS>
In his discussions with the Minister of Education and the leadership of the University of Brunei , Prime Minister Fa Minh Diem highly praised the achievements in educational cooperation between the two countries , including the collaboration between FPT University and Brunai University , as well as the introduction of Vietnamese language into the curriculum . <EOS>

Kim Jong-un 's father and daughter interact intimately and his wife is left behind <EOS>
North Korea held the 75th anniversary parade on the evening of the 8th , with Kim Jong-un 's daughter Kim Jeong-hye not only attending , but also standing at the podium with her father . <EOS>
North Korean state media released a video on the 9th , showing Kim Jong-un with her father , several times looking at him with affection , making small talk , holding his face with both hands , even touching his chest , and the interactive picture of the father and daughter was broadcast throughout the country . <EOS>
However , First Lady Li Shi Huang was only able to step aside . <EOS>
In an official photo of Kim Jong-un and Lee Hsien Loong attending a dinner party on the 7th with their daughter Kim Jeong-Hye , Kim is not only rarely seen sitting in the middle of the C-seat with her parents , but also at the 75th anniversary parade the following evening . <EOS>
North Korean state media released a video of a military parade after the incident on North Korea 's Central Television , revealing more of the father-son bond . <EOS>
Kim Jong-un has faced his daughter several times on the chairman 's desk , and the smiles on their faces have never receded , as well as whispering in each others ears . <EOS>
Other official media footage also showed Kim with Kim Jong-un sitting on the indoor couch , constantly touching her father 's face with her hands ; she was holding hands as she walked with him and touched his chest . <EOS>
First Lady Lee could only walk in the back or sit on the side , always a few steps away from her husband and daughter . <EOS>
According to South Korean media , Kim Jong-un 's exposure has increased in the three months since his first public appearance on Nov. 18 to test the Mars 17 rocket , and this is the fifth time he has appeared on an official occasion . <EOS>
North Korean state media refer to Kim as " my dearest son , my noble son " and show clips of him repeatedly shouting " death to the white blooded " as he watched the parade from the stands . <EOS>
These signs have raised doubts about whether Kim Jong-un has been singled out as an heir to the Kim regime . The Washington Post 's analysis of the situation suggests that this is a sign that Kim is pushing his middle-school-aged daughter into the role of successor , although there is also the opinion that such a judgment is still premature and that there are still various possibilities in the case of Kim having a son on his knees . <EOS>
What exactly is the hydrogen bomb that was shot down over Alaska ? <EOS>
wandering about in vain speculation . <EOS>
The U.S. military again deployed its most advanced stealth fighter jet , the F-22 , on the afternoon of Friday ( February 10 ) to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska , USA . <EOS>
The crash site is 10 miles off the coast of Alaska . <EOS>
This is the second time the U.S. military has shot down a flying object in less than a week . <EOS>
On Saturday , a Chinese spy balloon was shot down over the US coast of South Carolina days after it drifted over US airspace . <EOS>
The Pentagon said the second downed object , which first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night and was tracked by the US military as it moved over northeastern Alaska , flew at an altitude of 12,000 meters ( 40,000 feet ) , was about the size of a small car and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier . <EOS>
The Pentagon also believes that at this time there is no indication that the object can be manipulated . <EOS>
White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator John Coby said on Friday that while it was not clear what the high-flying object looked like , it posed a legitimate threat to the safety of civil aviation aircraft . <EOS>
According to Kobe , the object is different from the spy balloon found in the United States , as it does not have a suspended pendant carrying a payload . <EOS>
The best description we can come up with at the moment is that we call it a mythical object mystery , says Kobe . <EOS>
President Biden listened to the Pentagon 's advice before ordering the object to be shot down , and he was very cautious in making the decision , Corby added . <EOS>
U.S. officials describe the object as being roughly the size of a small car , with no handlebars , no suspension , and flying at an altitude of about 10,000 meters . <EOS>
But this information still fails to answer basic questions , such as what the object is , what country it belongs to , and what its mission is . <EOS>
Many online analyses and speculations suggest that this could be another Chinese balloon . <EOS>
It may have come from China , like the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese one hovering over Latin America , both performing a mission in different locations . <EOS>
Some have also linked the Alaskan flying saucer to a UFO . <EOS>
The US Newsweek report quoted former US Congressman Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday that he hoped the UFO was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO . <EOS>
The irony of Liu confusing spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising , but it doesn 't deserve to trigger an interstellar conflict , Liu Meijer said . <EOS>
Major tweeted shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down . <EOS>
According to Newsweek , Major is not the only one who suspects the object is a UFO . <EOS>
Representative Tim Burchett , a Republican from Tennessee , criticized the government 's cover-up last month , demanding that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) publish a report on the UFO case . <EOS>

East Germany 's last communist prime minister dies today <EOS>
The successor of the Communist Party of East Germany , Hans Modrow , died last night at the age of 95 , the party reported in a statement . <EOS>
As a result , our party has lost an important leader . <EOS>
Oh , my God . <EOS>
On 13 November 1989 , four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall , which had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years , Moderro said he would help transform East Germany into a democratic state . <EOS>
At the time , the Communist Party leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom . <EOS>
On November 27 , 1763 , Mary Christine ‚Äô s daughter ( her daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter ‚Äô s daughter , Mary ‚Äô s daughter , died early after birth complications . <EOS>
After the Soviet Union came to power , Mikhail Gorbachev called for changes in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well . <EOS>
In March 1990 , Modro proclaimed the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic ( GDR ) . <EOS>
The results of the elections led him to no longer serve as prime minister . <EOS>
Despite his reforms , Modro 's opponents accused him of trying to delay the political change and unification that took place in October 1990 . <EOS>
He has also been criticized for trying to reform the secret police instead of abolishing it . <EOS>
In 1993 , Modro was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections , but did not go to jail . <EOS>
Some say the accusations are politically motivated . <EOS>
From 1990 to 1994 , Moderro continued to serve in the German parliament and was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004 . <EOS>
Modro sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the Communist Party from within . <EOS>
In 1999 , he told Reuters that he did not want the former East Germany to return , but that it should be recognized for its achievements . <EOS>
Modro was born in 1928 in what was then the German town of Jasenitz ( now Jasienica , Poland ) and trained as a mechanic . <EOS>
During World War II , he served as head of a youth fire brigade and soon after the conflict ended as a member of the Volkssturm , a Nazi militia organization that recruited men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight in the final war struggles . <EOS>
At the age of 17 , Modro was captured by Soviet troops and taken as a prisoner of war to the Soviet Union , where he attended an anti-fascist course and became a staunch Communist Party member . <EOS>
In 1949 , the year East Germany was founded , he returned home to find a job as a mechanic and continued his studies in social sciences and economics , obtaining a doctorate . <EOS>
Moderro was a staff member of the Free German Youth movement , to which almost all East German youth joined , and was promoted to chairman of Dresden 's regional party through the ruling Socialist Unity Party ( SED ) between 1973 and 1989 . <EOS>
He also served in the East German parliament for more than 30 years . <EOS>
In 1990 , Moder became the de facto leader of East Germany , holding the highest state office . <EOS>

4.1 Summary <EOS>
The characters in this document are encoded in single bytes , binary or quadrangular . <EOS>
The single-byte portion contains GB / T 11383 one 1989 0x00 ~ 0x7F for a total of 128 characters . <EOS>
4.3 Byte portion <EOS>
The two-byte portion contains all the graphic characters in GB / T 2312 and 1980 as well as the unified Chinese character CJK from GB / T 13000 . <EOS>
The characters in the two-byte section are as defined in Appendix A. <EOS>
In this case , the graphic , code position and function of the character descriptor shall comply with the provisions of Annex B. <EOS>
Note : GB / T 13000 is a unified Chinese character code for countries and regions such as China , Japan , Indonesia , and Vietnam . <EOS>
Chinese characters with a unique abstract font are assigned a separate code position ; those with different sources but the same abstracted font have a common code location . <EOS>
The encoded Chinese characters are known as CJK , the unified Chinese CCJK Unified Ideographs , in which CJ K stands for China , Japan , and Korea . <EOS>
4.4 Quad bytes <EOS>
In addition to the aforementioned two-byte GB / T 13000 characters , the Quaternary section contains 66 CJK Unified Chinese character extensions ( including 9FA6 and 9FEF , excluding 8 of the 9-FB4-9FBB ) and a number of minority-encoded character expansions such as F and GB . <EOS>
The characters in the four-byte section are as defined in Appendix C. <EOS>
5 General structure <EOS>
The representation of any number prefixed with 0x in the standard text uses the hexadecimal system , whereas the expression of non-zerox is decimal . <EOS>
All encodings in the appendix are represented by a hexadecimal system , while all other digits are decimal . <EOS>
The single-byte portion uses the GB / T 11383 one 1989 coding structure , allowing the use of 0x00 ~ 0x7F bytes . <EOS>
The binomial part represents a character with two eight-bit binary bit strings , with the first byte code bit from 0x81 to 1xFE , and the last bytecode bit is 0X40 , 1 X7E and 0 X80 , respectively . <EOS>
The four-byte portion uses GB / Work 11383 One 1989 Not used 0x30 One Ox39 As a follow-up to the expansion of the two-byte encoding , the coding range is 0X81308130 . <EOS>
The first byte of the four-byte character is 0x81 one-xFE ; the second one is 0,30 one , 0x39 ; the third is 1,0,81 ; and the fourth is 2,03 ; i.e. 0,8130 8130 1x8139 ; 1,081,830 8239 ; 2,810,030 FEFE ; 1,011,013 1813 ; 2,013,818 139 ; and 2,083,012 Oo2douolag0c 0URo23061393 0XFE39FE . <EOS>

Policy changes and trends <EOS>
Most jurisdictions that have legalized cannabis for non-medical use have a growing trend of cannabis use <EOS>
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada , Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use . <EOS>
In most of these jurisdictions , cannabis use has increased since legalization , although similar trends have been observed in other areas that have not legalized non-medical use of cannabis . <EOS>
In Colorado and Washington , two of the earliest states to pass legislation , non-medical marijuana use among adults has increased , especially in the past month , and daily or nearly daily use has surpassed the national average since 2012 . <EOS>
All indicators show that cannabis use in Uruguay has increased since 2011 , almost doubling in the last month . <EOS>
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the frequent and regular use of cannabis . <EOS>
Short-term data from Canada also showed that legal market expansion in 2018-2019 was accompanied by an increase in usage . <EOS>
However , in 2019 , 40 % of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources . <EOS>
Is the legalization of cannabis the reason behind the plunge in the global supply of marijuana strawberries ? <EOS>
In 2018 , global production of cannabis strawberries fell to its lowest level in 20 years , driven by a decline in North American production , which fell by 84 % over the past decade . <EOS>
In comparison , cannabis seizures in the rest of the world nearly doubled over the same period . The pattern of seized cannabis suggests that policies aimed at opening up the cannabis market played a key role in its decline . <EOS>
Regulations on novel psychoactive substances appear to have a deterrent effect and it is still difficult to assess the effects of domestic regulation of novel psychotropic substances . <EOS>
Several countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use of these substances . <EOS>
In other countries , the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased following the adoption of domestic legislation . <EOS>
Disadvantaged groups face harms from the market for legal and illegal drugs . The distribution of opioids for pain management and palliative care is uneven across regions , mainly in high-income countries . <EOS>
In 2018 , more than 90 % of all prescription opioids available for medical use were in high-income countries . <EOS>
About 50 % in North America , 40 % in Europe , and 2 % in Oceania . <EOS>
These countries account for about 12 % of the world 's population . <EOS>
It is estimated that 88 % of the world 's population lives in low- and middle-income countries , but less than 10 % consume pharmaceutical opioids . <EOS>
Barriers to access to the pharmaceutical opioid class are linked to many factors , including legislation , culture , health systems and prescription practices . <EOS>
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing a substance use disorder , with an estimated 35.6 million people suffering from drug addiction in 2018 . <EOS>
Poverty , limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorder and exacerbate its consequences . Research in high-income countries has confirmed this , and in these studies , an individual 's socioeconomic trajectory is not only related to their condition at a given point in time , but also to a drug-use risk . <EOS>
Drug use disorders also exacerbate socio-economic disadvantages , further increasing the risk of unemployment , poverty and homelessness , thereby fueling a vicious cycle of deprivation . These outcomes may also be related to demeaning attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system . <EOS>
Women , ethnic minorities and migrants , sexually diverse groups , people displaced by armed conflict or disaster , and people in rural areas may also be severely affected by substance use disorders or have difficulty accessing treatment services . <EOS>
According to the Disability Adjusted Life Years ( DALY ) indicator , which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost to disability and premature death , the effects of harmful drug use on the broader society have increased over the past decade . <EOS>
Between 2007 and 2018 , the number of disability-adjusted life years attributed to drug use increased by 17 % globally . <EOS>
The associated disability of liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C , which is common among injecting drug users , was particularly high , with an increase in life expectancy of 40 % . <EOS>
The complexity of the relationship between drugs and violence makes it difficult to establish all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and the violence . <EOS>
Limited global data suggest that intoxication may be a major contributing factor to homicide . <EOS>
However , alcohol seems to play a greater role than drugs in violent incidents . <EOS>
Although drug use can lead to crime , in some cases this link can be partially attributed to a number of intermediate factors , such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk , family environment and peer influence . <EOS>
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted . <EOS>
Large-scale organized criminal activity , including international drug trafficking , can be carried out in non-violent situations if there is a stable criminal structure . <EOS>
In the short term , the presence and extent of violence depends not on the quantity of trafficking but on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups , such as changes in the size of illegal markets , deaths or imprisonment of known criminals , and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another . <EOS>
A total of 25200 bits from 0xFD308130 to 0XFE39FE 39 are used for user customization zones . <EOS>
Other unoccupied four-byte bits are reserved for future file extension use . <EOS>

Code bit range <EOS>
Code generation option <EOS>
Overall Option <EOS>
Clearly state that the language of the input file is language ( rather than the default option that comes after the file name ) . <EOS>
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x ' option.language is encountered . <EOS>
Turn off any explicit mention of the language , hence the file RE AS E ` -x ' option based on the filename post-processing . <EOS>
If only part of the four stages ( pre-processing , compilation , assembly , connection ) is operated , the ` -x ' option ( or Ah after the file name ) can be used to tell geo where it starts , and ‚åí ~ -c ' , „Çô -s ' , or ‚â™ -E ' options to indicate where geo ends . Note that some option combinations ( e.g. , ‚îÉ -x cpp-output -E ' ) { i gee MEF = c compile or assemble a file , ETER . In the case of ERAI , GCC replaces the source file with ‚îÇ .o ' . <EOS>
I 'm not sure if this is a good idea . <EOS>
After the compilation , the assembly is stopped . <EOS>
Work between different stages of the compilation process is done using pipes rather than temporary files , as compilers on those systems cannot read data from a pipeline , which is not an issue with GNU 's assemblers . The compiler can accept C " dialects " : support for ANSI-compliant C programs . <EOS>
This will turn off certain non-compatible ANSI Cc feature keywords in GNU C c , as well as features such as unix and vax that are shown to be acceptable and rarely used , and will disable them despite the fact that all standard libraries under a hosted environment are available , the main function returns an int value , typically for almost all programs except the kernel . The corresponding independent environment ( f ¬£ reestanding environment ) does not exist and the input is not necessarily the primary program . <EOS>
Function declarations without arguments , such as `int foo ( ) ; ' , are handled in C-style -- i.e. do not specify the number or type of the argument ( for C + + only ) . <EOS>
Normally , such a function foo in C + + means that the parameters are empty . <EOS>
The list of sections is removed from here to try to support some aspects of traditional C compilers . <EOS>
See the NUc manual , we 've removed the details so that when the content is out of date , people won 't get HERI . <EOS>
Except for one thing : for C + + programs ( not C ) , the ` -traditional ' option has an add-on effect that allows the assignment of this . <EOS>
He is the same as the ' -This-is-variable ' option . <EOS>
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of traditional Cc preprocessors . <EOS>
In particular , what is mentioned above about the preprocessor , but not the other effects of the `-traditional ' option . <EOS>
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the character ` $ ' in the identifier ( for C + + only ) . <EOS>
You can specify `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers ' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the „Çô $ ' character . <EOS>
( GNU C + + allows the ` $ ' character in some target systems by default , but not all systems . ) <EOS>
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of ant type to enumeration type ( MEF c + + ) . <EOS>
Normally , GNU C + + allows conversion from enum to int , but not vice versa . <EOS>
-fexternal-templates generates smaller code for template declarations ( only limited to C + + ) , the method is to generate a copy for each template function only where they are defined . <EOS>
To successfully use this option , you must mark ` # pragma implementatio ' ( ( definition ) or „Çô # Pragm interface ' ( statement ) in all files that use the template . <EOS>
When a program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates ' , the template instantiation is all of an external type . You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file . <EOS>
This can be done with typedef , which he cites for every instance needed . <EOS>
Correspondingly , if the default option ` -fno-exteznal-templates ' is used when compiling , all template instances are explicitly set to built-in . <EOS>
All member functions ( except the constructor subfunction and the mnew or delete member operator ) are considered to be false functions of their class . <EOS>
This does not mean that every time a member function is called , it will pass through the internal virtual function table . <EOS>
In some cases , the compiler is able to determine that a virtual function can be directly called ; in this case , it is called directly . <EOS>
-fcond-mismatch Allows type mismatches of the second and third parameters of a conditional expression . <EOS>
The value of this expression is the Void.-fthis- is-variable which allows the assignment of a value to this ( only for c + + ) . <EOS>
The incorporation of user-customized free storage management mechanisms into C + + makes the value-assignable ' this ' seem unfashionable . <EOS>
Therefore , by default , the assignment of this to the class member function is invalid . <EOS>
However , for backward compatibility , you can make this operation work by using the `-fthis- is-variable ' option . <EOS>
-funsigned-char Defines char as a non-symbolic type , such as unsignred char . <EOS>
Each machine has its own default char type . It can be either unsigned char or signed char . <EOS>
Ideally , a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on data symbolicity . <EOS>
However , many programs have been written using only the simple char , and this is either symbolic ( or non-symbolic , depending on the target machine that is writing the program ) . <EOS>
This option , and its counter-options , allows that program to work at the corresponding default value . <EOS>
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char , even if it behaves exactly the same as one of them . <EOS>
If the modifier ` signed ' or ' unsigned ' is not explicitly stated , these options are used to define a bitfield or a non-symbol field . <EOS>
By default , bytes are symbolic because they inherit a basic integer type , such as int , which is symbolical , however , if the `-traditional ' option is specified , the byte is always unsymbolic . <EOS>
-fwritable-strings stores string constants to writable data segments without special treatment . <EOS>
This is to be compatible with some of the older programs , which consider changing the string constants a very bad idea . `-traditional ' option has the same effect . <EOS>

C and C + + compilers are integrated . They all handle input files in one or more of four steps : preprocessing , Hii ( compilation ) , assembly , and MERE ( linking ) . <EOS>
Source file suffixes identify the language of the source file , but for compilers , the alias controls the default setting : <EOS>
gcc considers the pre-processed file ( ( .i ) to be a c file and sets the connection in the form of c . <EOS>
g + + considers the pre-processed file ( .i ) to be a C + + file and sets up connections in the form of C + + . <EOS>
The source file suffix indicates the language type and the later operation : <EOS>
.c C source code ; preprocessing , compilation and assembly <EOS>
.C C + + source code ; preprocessing , compilation and assembly <EOS>
.cc C + + source code ; preprocessing , compilation and assembly <EOS>

Name and content of harmful substances in the product <EOS>
Hazardous substances This form is prepared in accordance with SJ / T 11364 . <EOS>
O : Indicates that the hazardous substance is present in all homogeneous materials of the component in accordance with the limit requirements of GB / T 26572 . <EOS>
Increased complexity <EOS>
The emergence of non-internationally regulated substances is stable , but the market for potentially dangerous new opioids is increasingly complex . <EOS>
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis , cocaine and heroin , hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added , many of which are not under international regulation . <EOS>
Approximately 500 new active substances are placed on the domestic market of the Member States each year . <EOS>
Currently , most of these are stimulants , followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and small amounts of opioids . <EOS>
Although the overall amount of new psychoactive substances has stabilized , the proportions have changed . <EOS>
Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014 , the opioid class accounted for only 2 % but by 2018 this figure had risen to 9 % . <EOS>
Many of the novel opioid psychoactive substances in the class are analogues of fentanyl , whose pharmacological effects and harms have been shown to cause overdose deaths in North America and other regions , but to a lesser extent . <EOS>
In North America , fentanyl is sometimes used as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs ( including cocaine and methamphetamine ) , and sometimes in the manufacture of counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids . <EOS>
Some evidence also suggests the phenomenon of the injection of new psychoactive substances in Europe : a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes contained a new stimulant substance called potassium <EOS>
2 The use of new psychoactive substances may become increasingly prevalent in vulnerable groups <EOS>
New psychoactive substances in a single class almost never have a large market . <EOS>
However , evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabis is a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates . <EOS>
Twenty-two countries reported the use of novel psychoactive substances in prisons , most of which identified synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge . <EOS>
Regulation of precursor chemicals has forced innovators to innovate , most commonly as precursors used to synthesize drugs such as acetaminophen , methamphetamine and tetrahydrocannabinol . <EOS>
Drug traffickers and drug manufacturers have been looking for alternatives not only to looser-regulated substances , but also to chemicals specifically designed to evade regulation , the so-called methylprednisolone . <EOS>
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze addicts who rely on precursor chemicals . <EOS>
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality : In March 2020 , it was reported that a shortage of methylprednisolone precursors imported from East Asia led to a rise in the price of methylamide in Mexico and the United States . <EOS>
The market is changing . <EOS>
Synthetic drugs replace opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation <EOS>
The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation seems to have changed between 2008 and 2018 . <EOS>
The number of opioids seized by the authorities of the Russian Federation decreased by about 80 % , while the number receiving treatment for opioid use dropped significantly . <EOS>
But the market for stimulants seems to be booming . <EOS>
There is evidence that methylphenidate and various calcium salts , including methoxychloroquine and a-hydroxyphenylamine , are now ubiquitously available on the Russian drug market . <EOS>
Russian authorities have reported a sharp increase in the number of secret processing facilities recently seized for the manufacture of various illegal drugs , more than doubling in two years to 152 in 2018 . <EOS>
Growth in the Afghanistan and Iraq methamphetamine markets <EOS>
As early as 2012 , investigations of hospital , prison and other institutional personnel revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq . <EOS>
Crystalline methamphetamine has become a major drug of concern , alongside ciprofloxacin and curcumin . <EOS>
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings , with drug users reporting that cannabis is harder to obtain than methadone or methamphetamine . <EOS>
Recently , several methamphetamine processing plants have been discovered by Iraqi authorities , and the Cannabis Regulatory Authority has expressed concern about the large-scale imports of pseudoephedrine preparations . <EOS>
In Afghanistan , methamphetamine production appears to have begun in 2014 . <EOS>
Since then , methylphenidate seizures have been steadily increasing . <EOS>
However , in the first half of 2019 , the capture of 1 ^ 657 kg of tuna increased dramatically compared to the previous year . <EOS>
Large quantities of methamphetamine believed to have originated in Afghanistan have been seized in other countries , indicating that production is rising rapidly in the country . <EOS>
The execution summary <EOS>
The impact of coronavirus on the drug market <EOS>
The impact could be similar to the economic crisis of 2008 . <EOS>
The global COVID-19 outbreak has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis . <EOS>
In many countries , the disease has left healthcare institutions overwhelmed and on the brink of collapse , and restrictive measures put in place by governments have caused serious disruption to the global economy . <EOS>
The impact of the epidemic on the drug market is unclear and difficult to predict , but it has the potential to be far-reaching . <EOS>
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs because restrictions on movement also restrict access to precursors and basic chemicals . <EOS>
Traffickers are unable to cross the border due to travel restrictions and may have to find new routes and methods . <EOS>
The patterns of drug use and supply may change , and the government 's ability to respond may be hampered . <EOS>
The transformation brought about by COVID-19 is unprecedented , but lessons can be learned from past crises . <EOS>
Following the 2008 economic crisis , some drug users started looking for cheaper synthetic substances and switched to injectable drugs . <EOS>
At the same time , governments are cutting drug-related budgets . <EOS>
Interventions such as prevention of drug use and associated risk behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard if governments respond to the current recession in the same way . <EOS>
In addition , the priority of international cooperation in interception may be reduced , making it easier for traffickers to act . <EOS>
Some countries have large quantities of drugs being smuggled on commercial flights and are expected to be the countries most directly affected by drug trafficking . <EOS>
Some messengers carry synthetic drugs , such as methamphetamine , in their backpacks or hidden in private luggage , sometimes in large quantities . As air passenger transportation is restricted in almost all parts of the world , the supply of drugs using commercial air travel may be completely interrupted . <EOS>
Although international postal supply chains have also been disrupted , trafficking using the dark web and freight mail may increase . <EOS>
In the long run , the recession and related closures could disrupt the drug market . <EOS>
It is the Lord of the Lords , the Lord of the Lords , the Lord of the Lords . <EOS>
As a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunities , poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways , develop substance use disorders , and turn to illicit drug-related activities , whether in production or transport . <EOS>
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable groups and recruit new members to strengthen their ranks . <EOS>
These changes could quickly take root and become a new reality for many communities as the government 's capacity to respond declines . <EOS>
Expansion and Complexity <EOS>
Growth of the market <EOS>
Population growth patterns partly explain why the market is expanding <EOS>
Drug use has been on the rise around the world , both in terms of overall numbers and the proportion of drug users in the global population . <EOS>
In 2009 , there were an estimated 210 million drug users , or 4.8 % of the global population aged 15-64 , compared to 269 million or 5.3 % in 2018 . <EOS>
Over the past two decades , drug use in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries . <EOS>
This partly reflects the differences in the overall population growth over this period , with developed countries accounting for 7 % and developing countries for 28 % , but also the rapid growth of the young population in developing nations . <EOS>
Teenagers and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users . <EOS>
Between 2000 and 2018 , the population of this age group in developing countries grew by 16 % , while that of developed countries decreased by 10 % . <EOS>
1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets <EOS>
Drugs are more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas , both in developed and developing countries . <EOS>
Part of the reason for the overall increase in drug use is the massive migration of people from rural to urban areas , where more than half the world 's population now lives , up from 34 % in 1960 . <EOS>
Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets , especially in developing countries where the trend is more pronounced . <EOS>
Increased wealth is strongly associated with increased drug use , but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the poorest people worldwide , and drug abuse is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing ones . <EOS>
Drugs such as cocaine are also strongly linked to the wealthier parts of the world . <EOS>
Similarly , in different parts of the country , the prevalence of drug use is higher among the wealthy social classes . <EOS>
However , a higher proportion of people with lower socioeconomic status convert to drug use disorder . <EOS>
Data from a handful of countries suggest a link between harmful drug use patterns and morbidity and low income . <EOS>
These patterns seem to be less common in wealthier sections of society . <EOS>
The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to increase the risk to the most vulnerable groups , including drug users . <EOS>
For example , changes in the labor market , such as rising unemployment rates , have been linked to an increase in drug use , an epidemic that has put tens of millions of people out of work around the world . <EOS>
The coronavirus pandemic may result in more farmers growing or engaging in illegal crop cultivation , or due to reduced control capacity of the national authorities or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illicit activities under the economic crisis . <EOS>
The associated COVID-19 restrictions have led to a decrease in air and land traffic , which may have resulted in an increase in maritime trafficking , a lower risk of interception at sea , and a greater number of cases of smuggling than air or land . <EOS>
Recently , there have been reports of cocaine shipments being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea . <EOS>
The latest trends <EOS>
Smoking cannabis is the most commonly used substance , and opioids are most dangerous . <EOS>
An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018 , making it the most widely used drug in the world . <EOS>
In comparison , 58 million people used opioids in 2018 . <EOS>
However , the associated dangers of opioids are largely ignored due to the small number of users . <EOS>
Of the estimated 167,000 drug-related deaths in 2017 , 66 % were caused by these substances and 50 % of the 21 million years of life lost to disability or premature death believed to be due to drug use . <EOS>
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis <EOS>
In West , Central and North Africa , the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Kumado ; in North America , by fentanyl . The two regions have little in common in terms of economics , demographics , or general patterns of drug use , but are struggling to combat opioids fueled by readily available and low-cost substances . <EOS>
In North America , the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years . <EOS>
In 2018 , two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States were related to fentanyl . <EOS>
Canada reported similar results , but with lower numbers . <EOS>
Fentanyl leads to overdose deaths in part due to the unpredictability of the drug on the illicit drug market . <EOS>
In West , Central and North Africa , the market for non-medical curcumin has grown significantly . <EOS>
In the region , treatment for Kumamoto is increasingly being used by patients with the disease . <EOS>
In 2017 , the majority of horses harvested globally increased significantly , reaching a peak of over 125 tonnes . <EOS>
In 2018 , however , the global capture fell to 32 tonnes after India passed a new law regulating curcumin . <EOS>
Both crises were fueled by the simplicity of manufacturing and the low cost of production , as well as the lack of international regulation for Kumado and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors . <EOS>
Adding to both crises is the availability of these substances on both the drug and illicit markets , making them harder to detect and prevent abuse . <EOS>
Increased use of stimulants <EOS>
The doping sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine , both of which are on the rise in their major markets . <EOS>
An estimated 19 million people used cocaine in 2018 , due to its popularity in North America and Western Europe . <EOS>
Approximately 27 million people used acetaminophen in the same year , with methamphetamine being the most commonly used stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America . <EOS>
According to most of the indicators available , the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding over the past 20 years . <EOS>
In some markets , cocaine and methamphetamine can co-exist , sometimes interchangeably , with the use of one drug decreasing as that of the other increases , and sometimes increasing and declining simultaneously to meet demand in the same market . <EOS>
Coronavirus puts injecting drug users at increased risk <EOS>
It is estimated that about 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018 , and about 10 % of the global HIV infection is due to injection drug use . <EOS>
More than one million people are infected with HIV from injecting drug users and 5.5 million are living with hepatitis C. <EOS>
In 2017 , about 585,000 people died from drug-related deaths , half of them from hepatitis C-associated liver disease . <EOS>
5 Opioid shortages caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute more readily available substances , such as alcohol or aspirin , or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs . <EOS>
As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently , more harmful uses may emerge . <EOS>
It 's a different experience . <EOS>
It 's almost top-of-the-line electric , and there are a lot of different brushing styles , but very few people brush differently every day . <EOS>
I used it for six months without any problems , brushing every day , washing almost every Monday . <EOS>
It is also cheaper to buy hairbrush accessories on Amazon . <EOS>
The World Nature Foundation has identified the main habitat types of 12 freshwater ecological areas : large Lakes , Great River Triangle , Polar Freshwater , Mountain Freshwater , Mediterranean Coastal Rivers , Mediterranean Plains and Flows , Mediterranean Plains , Tropical and Sub-Tropical Coastal Rivers , Tropical and Sub-Tropical Plains and Plains , Tropical and Sub-Tropical Plains and Plains , Tropical and Sub-Tropical High Plains , Sub-Tropical Plains and Sub-Tropical Plains , Sub-Tropical Plains and Sub-Tropical Plains . <EOS>
The app is a bit tricky to use , apart from changing the colors , other apparent compatibility issues are the reason for the overseas version ? <EOS>
I hope to study law . <EOS>
Just the right size . <EOS>
Breastplate 99 , height 184 , weight 84 kg , before buying consulted customer service was told to buy xxxl , then watched the review decided to get L , after receiving the goods found the size is right , almost was pitched . <EOS>
The price of Double Eleven is much higher than that of Black Friday . <EOS>
The quality of the clothes is very good . <EOS>
Sony is good . <EOS>
Sony 's low-end device , which is still well-designed , is cheap , has a large screen , and is very durable , making it suitable for older people . <EOS>
Although a long time has passed , the machine is still in good shape . <EOS>
But since my Z2 is down , this phone has done its job . <EOS>
The worst online shopping experience <EOS>
After placing the order on September 28 , the system showed that the shipment had been dispatched , and the result was that we waited until October 12 and still did not receive it . <EOS>
I checked the order status on Amazon , the seller did not provide the express delivery number , and I could not find where my order was . <EOS>
So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide a delivery number , and two days passed without a response . <EOS>
In desperation , I called Amazon customer service , the customer told me the seller 's mobile number , and I phoned again to ask the shopkeeper , after a few calls the phone rang and was told that the express package was lost and they could immediately send me another one . <EOS>
Although I was especially angry , I didn 't say much to the seller because I needed the computer urgently , so I told him to send it to me immediately . <EOS>
As a result , I called the next day and asked if the shipment had been delivered . <EOS>
The seller says no , it will be delivered in the afternoon . <EOS>
I called again in the afternoon and asked , the seller said it would be delivered , it was delivered after 5 : 00 or 6 : 00 p.m. , so I waited until 7 : 00 pm to call , but no one answered . <EOS>
I called again the next morning and asked if the package had been sent out . <EOS>
Can you tell me the order number ? <EOS>
The seller said no , told me I was in a hurry , let me order from another house , if I can wait , it will be sent in the afternoon . <EOS>
There 's no way , I 'll have to wait a long time to order from someone else . <EOS>
The only thing you can do is ask the seller to hurry the shipment . <EOS>
After countless phone calls , I finally received a computer on October 16th . <EOS>
As for the quality of the computer , I don 't know , because I bought it for someone else , let 's add a comment later . <EOS>
I don 't like the taste <EOS>
The child does not like the taste of toothpaste , and every time he says " hey " , maybe it is better to describe it with another word , which is the only word in the child 's vocabulary for the time being . <EOS>
I bought it at the time of the event , it was cheap , so I 'm not sorry to give it a bad review , four stars , but I won 't buy it again . <EOS>
FYI <EOS>
I have not tried it yet , but have always trusted Philips , hoping for a longer battery life than other brands . <EOS>
I checked online , it may be a waterborne disease , and there is no guarantee . <EOS>
It 's turquoise ! <EOS>
How long will the protective film continue to be wrapped up and unintelligible ? <EOS>
A quick guide to internet finance <EOS>
The book is shallow and can be said to be just an introductory lesson , which can help you quickly understand the whole picture of internet finance , but to understand it more deeply , you have to dig deeper yourself . <EOS>
The book was written earlier than expected , and later Alipay WeChat did not mention the use of subsidies to develop user habits during the war , so the third-party payment share today is not as small as the book says . <EOS>
Today , many people go out to eat with mobile phones , and businessmen have abandoned the bank because of high bank liquidity . <EOS>
However , I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book , seeing that he has at least several years of experience in financial observation and is very familiar with the history of financial developments in the country and abroad , so he can write such a commonly understood content . <EOS>
It 's easy to write with a lot of space , but the hard part is writing with common sense . <EOS>
I received the oil in the morning , and changed it the following afternoon . <EOS>
The second purchase . <EOS>
Amazon 's do-it-yourself products are reassuring . <EOS>
The teacher who changed the oil said that it was very clean and was really good oil . <EOS>
This is the second time I 've bought it . <EOS>
So I 'm very reassured . <EOS>
The speed of delivery , the packaging is not picky , and the engine noise is significantly reduced with this oil . <EOS>
The price is good , it 's hard to find synthetic oil under 200 . <EOS>
Support the star crown , support the victory card , and protect the car effectively . <EOS>
Delivery services to be improved <EOS>
I bought a total of 5 vouchers , and at the time of withdrawal , the first time I made a reservation to withdraw three , but only two were sent back , which was confirmed to be a leak after multiple communications ; the second appointment , just in time for the rest day , neither the website nor WeChat suggested booking on weekdays , causing unnecessary panic , suggesting improvement later . <EOS>
The image quality is unacceptable . <EOS>
As a title for a collection of ancient maps , the selection , type , and printing of the images are unacceptable , with some images even having mosaics , blurry to the point of being unrecognizable . <EOS>
Even if this book is not a professional map book , even if it is a miniature illustration , it should be a good source of medieval literature on the ocean landscape left by our ancestors in the catalogue ! <EOS>
What 's the difference between putting together a book with pictures like this and not using pictures ? <EOS>
I am sorry for this kind of academic spirit . <EOS>
It is not a matter of judgement , each party has its own opinion . <EOS>
Overall 2 stars . <EOS>
The experience of melancholy <EOS>
The filter , which was purchased online earlier , worked well , and after 28 days , it was used for another day or two without the same liquid . <EOS>
Since everything that has been bought on Amazon can be of any quality , this time I was thinking of buying here , the first time in Amazon to buy silicone chips , it doesn 't feel very good , not only does it start to get moisture early , and the silicon chips have been used until the 28th day , there will be a small black carbon powder hanging , I really do not know whether to continue using it , or just throw it away , very sad ~ <EOS>
Traffic is too slow <EOS>
It was shown on October 16th and the results were received on the 21st , poor rating ! <EOS>
The delivery is so bad , buying on Amazon would be slow , I didn 't expect it to be so slow ! <EOS>
It 's all right ! <EOS>
Amazon pictures are in italics , and the result sent to me is in brackets , isn 't that cheating ? <EOS>
Things are good . <EOS>
Things went well , I sent it to my girlfriend , but it was a little unpleasant when I wasn 't in Canada in the middle of the day , and the logistics company put the mail directly in my mailbox and did not send me a confirmation text message , which made me run away . <EOS>
But the baby is really good . <EOS>
I 've been using this product for less than a year and I have two E2s , I don 't know what to do ? <EOS>
I bought the product on July 30 , 2015 , but in March 2016 , the two sets on the right of the receiver often appear red E2 , it should be a problem with the launch module , which is not very consistent with Amazon 's website that the launcher module has been working sustainably for 7 years . <EOS>
This AV power loader has a complex setup , rough workmanship , and high heat output . <EOS>
The voice needs to be re-evaluated for a while ! <EOS>
DN1080 , the German edition of which I just received on August 14th . <EOS>
1 . The front panel , the knob are all plastic . <EOS>
2 . The back panel audio input socket , the horn output terminal are both poor , even if you look for a 1000-2000 CD player , it is much better than this one . <EOS>
3 . The top cover is relatively thin , the side of my transformer is also loose , and I have to open the box to restore it by hand , loosening the cover and the front panel together . <EOS>
The entire machine 's center of gravity is tilted towards the transformer edge , so that it does not twist when moving . <EOS>
It feels like a Sony entry-level machine , made in Malaysia . <EOS>
I feel Sony is better off in China than Chihuahua . <EOS>
5 . The machine heats up , the two sound channels used in the cinema for 2 hours or so . Cover the top with your hand and touch it to 40-50 ¬∞ C , don 't know if the transformer is too hot . <EOS>
Now with more switching power , the enormous transformer is estimated to weigh 4kg . <EOS>
Sony is supposed to have a silent fan in the machine that actively deflates the heat , and when the box is opened , it only sees a large silicon heat sink on the tube . <EOS>
A little bit of regret ! <EOS>
This is a fairly affordable price to buy Arthur 's , of course there are even lower prices in the reviews . <EOS>
Now let 's talk about shoes , the advantages : shoes are lightweight , running is comfortable , and the feet fit better , not loose . <EOS>
The value is high , but the disadvantages are also obvious : I usually wear 40 shoes , this time I bought 40.5 , and the distance to the front of the shoe is probably one thumb away , however , it doesn 't matter . <EOS>
The shoe is very narrow , and although the front is still some distance away , it feels tight . <EOS>
Also , the shoes may not be well ventilated , and now they feel hot on the feet . <EOS>
The battery is not full . <EOS>
The machine is really good , I wonder why the first time it was charged it wasn 't full , the charging indicator is always red . <EOS>
Size and flow <EOS>
It is possible to do the work , but the logistics are too slow , the previous shoes were all DHL , this time Apex is really ... I bought a lot of UA domestically , prices are not low , it feels funny than NIKE ADIDAS higher grade ? <EOS>
In fact , it 's all the same . <EOS>
Size : I am 176 cm tall , 68 kg , my shoulders are 180 in width , I bought an M , the bottom is slightly longer , others are fine , do I recommend an S-code , is my body so slender ? <EOS>
The pencil is still available , but it is too lightly packaged , like a cardboard box , with no protective measures , and the box containing the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent adhesive , which tears away all the wax on the boxes . <EOS>
This is how you treat a $ 600 item , a disappointing purchase . <EOS>
But the pen is fine . <EOS>
I hope to improve on the packaging later ! <EOS>
The golden thread will fade . <EOS>
The effect is still there , but whether or not the sensation is noticeable depends on the individual 's reaction , or the psychological effect . <EOS>
One thing that is not so good is the golden line , which was designed to look good , but in fact , the gold line will fade and be put on the car , if you move it a few times , on your hands , and on it , there will be some gold powder . <EOS>
I hope the product can be improved . <EOS>
It 's so square and has no decorative effect , so don 't mess with the gold wire , fall in the car and get in trouble . <EOS>
Counterfeit goods , especially fake ones <EOS>
Amazon sells counterfeit products , and I 'm addicted too . <EOS>
The customer said that they could not return it because they had used it , so I didn 't know if it was a fake . <EOS>
Because of trust , so sad , after all it 's a face covering item , really go to the physical store and buy it . <EOS>
I have submitted my e-commerce platform to the National Bureau of Industry and Commerce , let 's defend it together . <EOS>
The only thing I can say is , " Combine " . <EOS>
The time is not very accurate , about one second a day , and it 's almost doubled in just a few months . <EOS>
If you 've used a piece of cast-iron before , it feels like a year or two won 't be any less than a few seconds . <EOS>
The function of the millennial calendar is quite good , the timing function is a bit stiff , it is basically useless , occasionally mistakenly entering the timer mode . <EOS>
Confessions of a customer <EOS>
Amazon customer service tells you not to rush , we 'll get back to you in about 54 hours . <EOS>
2 Then , in the middle , you contact the customer service representative , who will tell you that the problem will be handled by a commissioner and he will inform you of the outcome . <EOS>
You never get in touch with the commissioner , you don 't know her job number , and there is no direct line , which means that you cannot contact her , only she can contact you . <EOS>
3 The tragedy is that after waiting for almost 3 days , the Commissioner contacted me , my mobile phone left for a moment , and I didn 't get a call from him . <EOS>
I waited for two hours and did not get a call from the commissioner , during which time I contacted Amazon customer service and emailed them to call me back . <EOS>
It 's been almost 3 days and I still don 't know what Amazon will do with this scrap coffee machine I received ! <EOS>
5 Amazon 's products in the United States are not a problem , buying overseas is a good way to shop , but it is far worse than the service in Asia . <EOS>
6 For me , all I can do is wait ... <EOS>
Good quality and fun . <EOS>
It 's fun , components are high precision , workmanship is sophisticated , the quality is almost the same as Lego , and the price is very affordable when doing activities . <EOS>
The process of piecing together is quite fun , I came to piece together and my 5-year-old son played , it 's good . <EOS>
He joked that he would probably continue to buy this brand of toys in the future . <EOS>
A sleeve that makes it incomprehensible <EOS>
The sleeve of the jacket is unintelligible . It is usually a little longer than the dress , but usually 1-2 cm . The dress is 5 cm long , and the arms should naturally hang in the palm of your hand . <EOS>
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to make it happen . <EOS>
This is a product with a very simple design style . <EOS>
The shape of the cube , the top of which is treated by the designer into a microscopic arc surface . <EOS>
It was supposed to be a very smooth line . <EOS>
Unfortunately , the end result was not achieved . <EOS>
This is because the top has two components , the control panel in front and the water box top cover in the back . <EOS>
The curvature of the top cover and the control panel are not consistent , resulting in a height difference of up to 2 mm or so after coupling . <EOS>
It seems to be a very small gap . <EOS>
But it has destroyed the whole sense of design . <EOS>
I feel a bit sorry for the product designer . <EOS>
It seems that the best product managers don 't have the ability to create a product of this level yet . <EOS>
( Of course , you can 't ask too much for the after-sales lady 's feedback , but when I heard after sales that all individuals of this product are like this , and not only I bought this one with a problem , her unconvinced and truthful heavy-handedness made me understand that I can not ask for a lot of beauty either ) 2019-7-7 The pump failed to produce enough water , it has been repaired a second time , two weeks after the first repairs it was broken again . <EOS>
Amazon 's customer service is terrible <EOS>
The order was placed two days ago , received today and found a discount of 40 bucks , it took a lot of time to find customer service , the customer said they could not make up the difference , they can buy again and return it . <EOS>
This customer experience and service is ten thousand times worse than some of the others . <EOS>
It 's good , but bad taste . <EOS>
First of all , it 's safe to say that Prime overseas buy-ups have been strong , with only number 6 under number 31 being received . <EOS>
The color of the shoes looks much better than the pictures , and the skin feels good . <EOS>
The shoe size is slightly larger , 25 feet long , 10.5 feet wide , 7.5W , and the upper leg is a little loose , but normally I like to wear a looser pair of shoes . <EOS>
Secondly , the taste of this shoe really does not dare to be complimented , one of the soles is damaged , and the other has scratches and a needle 's eye . <EOS>
ForRoyal Vans worldwide camera strap single reverse backrest <EOS>
The strap is designed to be scientific , shoulder-mounted , practical , and the chest is made of a soft material to secure and protect the camera , unlike other snipers who use a screw to attach the bottom of their camera . It is also convenient to take photos . <EOS>
It looks good , but it 's a bit of a pity . <EOS>
The color of the whole cup is my mother 's favorite , orange red , although my family is a boy , but I still find the pink and yellow bright eyes . <EOS>
It 's a little smaller than I thought , but it was meant to be taken out , so I 'll take it . <EOS>
I tried it at home last night and after pushing the bottle cap , the distance between the straw and the lid was too close because the position of the suction pipe was vertical , so my son always had to drink water with the bulge on the cover to see if this place could be improved . <EOS>
It seems that other brands of straw cups have a reasonable tendency to use straws , something that children really care about is safety and comfort . <EOS>
It 's not as good as I thought . <EOS>
Compared to the plugs I 've used in the past , the external work is generally done without removing the inside , but as described by the shopkeeper , from the point of view of ease of use , it shows whether each separate unit lacks electricity . <EOS>
Small packaging <EOS>
The e-commerce version is written on it and you know that it has fallen into the pit , it is smaller and better than the one bought in the supermarket . It should be M , and the packaging is not the same as the picture above , the so-called new version . <EOS>
The three stars are to blame for the fact that Mahou didn 't understand the specifications of the product , you sell M code e-commerce version I have no objection , what do you mean by the wrong version ? <EOS>
The e-commerce system is deep and I still have time to go to the supermarket and buy it . <EOS>
It 's about the purple . <EOS>
Overall , good , but a little bit of a problem . <EOS>
The first time I bought a pump , after reading a few reviews , I felt that the price of LAICA was higher , so I chose this one . I received the product according to the instructions , the pump was fitted , tried it , it felt good overall , but at the time of pouring the water it seemed as if the raw water would mix with the treated water from the mouth ( the original water tank seal is not very strict ) . <EOS>
When you use it , you have to wait until all the water is filtered and then pour it out ! <EOS>
It 's not cheap . <EOS>
Because the reviews are all good , everyone is looking forward to this sauce , I like it when I hold it , it is very light , but when opening it I found out the problem , the bottom of the pot is not flat , in the middle protruding , around the corner , oil is running around , specially purchased open the big fat meat exploded a lot of oil can not cover the central area , paste , open , such a construction is estimated to be unable to properly cook vegetables . <EOS>
I don 't know if I was unlucky or not , but I got a really bad one , and thanks to Amazon 's one-month return service , I decided not to buy it . <EOS>
I brushed my hair clean and clean , and I worked for half a day . <EOS>
Solar powered sports watches <EOS>
Advantages : solar charging without worrying about battery replacement , world time , multi-channel chargers and full-screen reminders . <EOS>
Disadvantages : Scratches on the mirror and dust . <EOS>
Price-to-earnings ratio : The average domestic price is between 220-300 and more than 180 ( about a week ) are available overseas . <EOS>
It 's not clear if the skin is genuine . <EOS>
The overall feeling is good , you can 't judge blindly without knowing if it 's real skin or not . <EOS>
An A4-sized file can be loaded with 80 pages thick , but a box-like object that is too heavy ( that cannot be deformed ) is estimated to be unloaded . <EOS>
The packaging is soft , the inner bag separation is more humane , but it 's still pretty good . <EOS>
It 's just that I have a little sandy eye at the bottom of this one , I don 't know if I 'm a bad person or not . <EOS>
I had to fold up to come back and exchange the goods , I endured . <EOS>
Overall , it 's worth a four star rating . <EOS>
Good shopping <EOS>
Something good ! <EOS>
It 's easy to buy from abroad and it takes a few days to get back to the country , but the clearance capacity of Amazon is still very strong , so many things are now bought overseas . <EOS>
Hopefully the quality and price of domestic goods will be better , many things are domestically produced , but go out and buy a round and come back cheaper than at home , hoping to improve . <EOS>
The little lion that fell <EOS>
When I picked up the book , I thought it would be as simple as a lost pencil eraser , and it turned out to be a lot of words ! <EOS>
After reading the book three times , I read it to the children , a little lion who shoots and loves to eat fruit juice and candy . <EOS>
It 's a little uncomfortable to see a lion eat a hunter , and modern city dwellers are somewhat unacceptable about this arrangement of being eaten by animals . <EOS>
At the end of the day , this little lion who has succeeded in human society , has lost himself , he is no longer a complete lion or a full human . <EOS>
In the end , there is only the shadow of the little lion , who doesn 't know where he went . <EOS>
Perhaps years later , the image of the little lion will remain in the minds of young children who have grown up and will be reminded of it at an unexpected moment , perhaps touching or inspiring them . <EOS>
Keep going . <EOS>
The first purchase is bad . <EOS>
It doesn 't feel like new . <EOS>
The label on the box was torn , and the label in the machine was broken . <EOS>
And it 's always a white screen . <EOS>
It 's better to change later . <EOS>
The exchange was quick , the night was a bit blurry , and the view wasn 't very wide , but it was enough for the average household . <EOS>
It 's not enough to not have a card , to buy one yourself , and to have previously bought a phone on Amazon . <EOS>
There will be a sticker on the packaging to prevent the package from being opened , this time there is not , and when you buy a mobile phone , there will also be an identical sticky chapter , which can be affixed to the warranty card . <EOS>
I don 't know if it 's cheap or not , I 'm confused . <EOS>
I just bought it six months ago , didn 't use it a couple of times , and now I 've had bad contact , can I ask if I can repair it ? <EOS>
I 've been using it a few times since I bought it because I have a desktop computer . <EOS>
I 've only used it a few times in my fashion bag on business . <EOS>
Recently it was discovered that when connecting the power supply , it does not charge , and you need to hold the charger and the connection of the wire with your hand to charge it . <EOS>
Do you suspect that the interface is poorly connected and you don 't know if it can be repaired now ? <EOS>
Amazon 's customer service is unbelievable . <EOS>
I don 't think a lot of people have seen this , but let me say something . <EOS>
The dress we bought at the time was a straw hat shirt , and the last thing I received was actually a short sleeve . <EOS>
After receiving the clothes , I immediately contacted Amazon customer service , which confirmed that they were still in stock , and I asked for a change , the customer said to fix it , then immediately saw the name of the product turned into a short sleeve and the link to my original purchase was removed . <EOS>
The customer then informs the customer to either keep the goods for a certain amount of compensation or return them . <EOS>
Is this how Amazon handles it ? <EOS>
It 's hard to believe that the clothing itself isn 't my problem , that as a consumer I ask for what I deserve without asking too much , and Amazon changes its name to " No Inventory " . <EOS>
This is my first long review and I hope it won 't be my last . <EOS>
Serious cargo is not on board . <EOS>
It 's very cheap and not on the board . <EOS>
The material of the headband is good . <EOS>
It 's better than Nike . <EOS>
The ventilation is also good . <EOS>
It 's just the hat in the front . <EOS>
It 's very subtle . <EOS>
Do you want to make fun of me ? <EOS>
It is not possible to completely cover the sun . <EOS>
I 'm not returning it because it 's good as a headband . <EOS>
It 's like wearing it up , even though it doesn 't cover the sun . <EOS>
But it is different from other types of headbands . <EOS>
I 'll leave it at that . <EOS>
There are minor flaws , sound is good . <EOS>
The harp has defects , a missing horn , feels like a second-hand product , and there is no gift , but the price is good , the sound is also good . <EOS>
Yaran 's mattress is really good . <EOS>
The 34 cm mattress is not the usual thickness , so you can not sleep on the bed directly . <EOS>
The quality is good , both the front and the back are quite soft , the sleep is comfortable , laying on it is easy to fall asleep . <EOS>
After receiving the mattress , Yalan Customer Service was very responsible and effective in contacting them and solving the problem . <EOS>
The boat is new and the seafood is good . <EOS>
The price of the previous purchase was 150 bucks , but the delivery was a bit slower . <EOS>
The machine is still good , all new . <EOS>
The pickaxe is built-in . <EOS>
And then connecting the elf balls sends a dream . <EOS>
The gameplay is good , and the portability is better than the PS4 . <EOS>
I 've already bought Zelda , wait for the game , try again . <EOS>
Logistics is neglected <EOS>
It was sent in this way , not only packed with presses , but also the electrical packaging was unpacked , and I don 't know if it was repackaged . <EOS>
Waiting for a response from suppliers <EOS>
The packaging does not have any markings , call the supplier directly and tell them that it is genuine , such as if you suspect that you can use edges to mail to Johnson 's check-in , leave the license plate number and phone number , promise to send a text message informing you to enter my information in the Johnson website warranty card , and have not received any text so far ? <EOS>
Amazon itself shouldn 't have this product . <EOS>
It 's a good product to buy at a special price , the price is not low , and the reviews are also very good . <EOS>
In fact , when I received the product , I was stunned , the surface area of the goods was worn out , and in many other places there was wear and tear , not secondary or old products , as shown later . <EOS>
I applied for a refund and the manufacturer saw the picture and said it was caused by transportation , isn 't that a blunder ? <EOS>
How can wear and tear occur inside a commodity ? <EOS>
There are only two possibilities , either second-hand goods , or I willfully damage the goods and take them back . <EOS>
Objectively , I have no proof that I didn 't damage the product , but based on my credit history of shopping on Amazon I think that this kind of product should not appear in Amazon self-service , the customer chooses Amazon is trust , customer win , we win . <EOS>
After all these years of excellence , the quality of the service is getting worse and worse ! <EOS>
Garbage excellency does not take into account the needs of customers , especially delivery time between 19 : 00 and 22 : 00 when ordering . <EOS>
An elderly person who is uncomfortable in bed after surgery at home can only receive a receipt at night . <EOS>
As a result , they went straight to the door at 12 o 'clock and did not call in advance . <EOS>
If the delivery time is what you couriers want , why waste time letting the customer choose ? <EOS>
If your logistics can 't guarantee service , then just stop doing e-commerce ! <EOS>
Let an old man with three wounds get out of bed and open the front desk and pay for the courier ! <EOS>
Please note that the contact number is on the order ! <EOS>
No one has called me from the beginning , please contact me and explain ! <EOS>
The so-called complaint service is a bunch of outsiders pretending to be there , plagiarizing your complaints and then giving you a supposed answer . <EOS>
There will be no change or compensation ! <EOS>
I 've had this problem before , but this time I can 't stand it , it 's too much ! <EOS>
After the pre-sale arrival of the new book , the cover and cover are wrong , so it is obvious that there is a quality problem and the book is sent to the customer blindfolded ? <EOS>
If you leave a negative comment , no one will contact you . <EOS>
After all these years of excellence , the quality of the service is getting worse and worse ! <EOS>
I 'm not going to spend a penny on excellence anymore . <EOS>
More suitable for young people <EOS>
99 seconds to kill . <EOS>
The workmanship , colour and feel of the wool are all good , soft / thin / thick , no kerosene taste . <EOS>
Unfortunately , the version belongs to the skinny type and is more suitable for young people . <EOS>
3XL , flat waist 2 feet 5 inches , maximum stretch size 4 feet , 1.79 / 80 kg with slightly tight waists . <EOS>
It seems that there is no loose belt , and it is difficult to loosen the belt a bit . <EOS>
In addition , it is uncomfortable to wear a patch . <EOS>
Good quality chicken wrapped well <EOS>
The packaging is complete , with an inflatable bag inside , there are no online reviews , just a glimpse of what the product looks like . <EOS>
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle , as described in the picture , and the delivery was quick . <EOS>
I 've been using the 925-25 , very good , I just received the 925 . The quality of the pen is undeniable , the style is also very beautiful , so I gave it four stars because it 's a little heavy , not suitable for fast writing , pen cap adjusting the length of fountain pen a bit wobbly , personal opinion : 925-25 is better than 85 . <EOS>

There are counterfeits <EOS>
The last time I bought two packages , they were actually two different versions , the words in the lower left-hand corner of the packaging were green , and the result was that one package was not , it was a white word , so the cat ate it and pulled his stomach . <EOS>
I 'm not sure if the Amazon shipment is fake or if it was packed by an employee at the time of shipping . <EOS>
I 'll buy it again , and if it 's a fake , I will hold you accountable . <EOS>
Image is incomplete <EOS>
The picture does not show the details of the sides , the side details are not in line with the subject 's style , there is a big difference , this is the first one ; this bead is from Thailand , without the indication of place of origin , that is its second ; no texture , it is three ; when I bought it in the UK , I distinguished each one with a box , here is only a simple simple plastic bag , and the beads do not have any product logo on them , where I judged it to be true or false . <EOS>
Buy with caution , especially if you buy from Hong Kong . <EOS>
It 's not a commodity , Amazon is shameless <EOS>
The page clearly states that it is self-owned , actually distributed by the supplier , and after the sale is the responsibility of the vendor . <EOS>
If you want to cancel your order , sorry , the order information has been passed to the supplier and cannot be canceled ; if you would like to return the goods , you have successfully requested a refund on Amazon . <EOS>
This is a self-service store . <EOS>
The product is not delivered by Amazon , Amazon does not cover the after-sales , the customer service says , " Hey , let me help you get in touch with the supplier " , and claims to be self-employed , too shameless , naked don 't face , nude cheating on consumers ! <EOS>
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I bought it with my first love of my life , who has been with me for almost 3 years , and this is how she left me last year , until now . <EOS>
I gave it 3 stars because I bought it with my first love and now I don 't know how much I 'm going to use it , maybe throw it away ! <EOS>
After being in a relationship for almost three years , this is how she left me last year , and even now , when I think of her , I want to leave this world with a heartbreak , the first woman in my life , who brought me a lifetime of shadows and heartache , which I have not been able to come out of until now . <EOS>
When I bought this phone , I thought about how it felt at the time , to be able to suffer together , but now I can 't bear to look back , maybe that 's what life is like , some people never want to meet in their lives , there are some things they never wanted to know . <EOS>
How many times when I see this Samsung phone , I think of her , and that pain fills my whole body . I have never used a mobile phone that cost more than 2,000 yuan , but I did not hesitate to buy it for her . <EOS>
If the packaging is damaged , wait to check the quality of the product . <EOS>
The outer packaging is badly damaged , the inside box looks new , but the instructions look like they 're not , it was refurbished in September , in the box , hopefully it won 't be bad by then , please explain to Amazon why several customers mentioned the package damage , and you can rest assured , thank you ! <EOS>
It 's also worth getting it for beginners . <EOS>
I 've seen the price in the mall before , at least a few hundred , and it 's my first time to play . <EOS>
You can . <EOS>
Advantages : This double shoulder bag is more refined and looks durable . <EOS>
Disadvantages : the two-dimensional code on the card can not be scanned , the 15.6-inch laptop cannot be put down , this double-shouldered zipper can be locked , but does not prepare a lock for the buyer . <EOS>
We strongly recommend that Amazon discontinue EMS ! <EOS>
Commodity five stars , logistics one star , average three stars . <EOS>
I don 't understand why Amazon sends EMS , it 's recognized in the industry as unreliable , well , computers are good and expensive ! <EOS>
After the purchase , the order showed that it was expected to arrive on the 20th , so the family waited at home for three days ! <EOS>
Why did it take four or five days to get from Xiamen to Fujian ? <EOS>
On the morning of the 22nd , the check-in logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou , preparing to open the checkout , and in the evening , without receiving any phone calls or text messages , they were signed at noon , showing their own signature ! <EOS>
I was instantly shocked ! <EOS>
Who am I ? Where am i ? Did I really buy this computer ? <EOS>
It 's okay to doubt your life ! <EOS>
In the end , I ran an iteration of the receiver and moved the computer back . <EOS>
The specific reason is simply because the delivery boy has turned the two single numbers upside down , so it is better if the piece is not lost . <EOS>
I strongly advise Amazon not to use EMS , and I will definitely not buy it again if Amazon sends it in the future . <EOS>
Trash <EOS>
When you see a package like this , ask yourself : Don 't you think it 's trash on the side of the road ? <EOS>
A plastic packaging that is fragile , sent in a plastic bag from so-called Germany , is such a package responsible ? <EOS>
I see such packaging as a piece of trash , buying this product , packing it in its simplicity , without any precautions to prevent it from breaking , wrapping in a simple plastic bag , and in the end , the package is completely deformed and the items inside are also damaged . <EOS>
If I just come across one of these , I 'll admit that I bought a few of them and then I go to Amazon customer service and they say I can withdraw , but I pay the shipping fee and it comes back to me in the form of a gift card . <EOS>
Let me ask you something , I pay for shipping in cash and you give me a gift card back , that 's for me to buy your gift cards myself , but to send the product to the German warehouse myself is not a crime ! <EOS>
And I keep saying to the customer , who is responsible for this problem , but they don 't say it 's their responsibility , even half a sentence , what is the guarantee of this kind of after-sales service ? <EOS>
But Amazon 's after-sales service is really much worse than other sites . <EOS>
After placing the order , it was found that there was an error , but the cancellation order has not been canceled , the web page contact online customer service has been showing the wrong link , can not be contacted . <EOS>
After the shipment , the courier called me , I said I don 't want to cancel the order and the cancellation was not successful , so he took it back and told me to sign it first and let me request a refund . <EOS>
When requesting a refund , the food category is informed that once the receipt is returned , there is no way to call Amazon customer service , which is the same as saying , receipts cannot be returned . <EOS>
I 've previously purchased non-returnable items in both Jingdong and Suning , including milk , diaper bags , etc . , and contact lenses have been returned , and the JINGDONG diapers taste too big to be returned when opened , so you can 't go to Amazon . <EOS>
The law is dead , and man is alive . What is the matter with you ? <EOS>
Tell me if I can get it myself or let the courier buy it for me , it would have been very difficult , why do I let people earn money to buy what I don 't buy ? <EOS>
I 'm not going to back down , I got it myself , but I have to give you a credit for your service . <EOS>
What 's wrong ? <EOS>
The counterfeit goods ? <EOS>
This is a tragedy . <EOS>
The pores selected for the second film are delicate , but once opened it has a strange smell , thinking it is normal , because I have not used it , and then when I put it on my face I can not stand the whole thing , a very pungent odor , indescribable , I coughed right away , my eyes are also painful , tears , immediately picked up to wash the face . <EOS>
In the meantime , another film of the same name , with a less serious flavor , is in the works . <EOS>
It reminds me a bit of the smell of poor quality lemonade in the hallway . <EOS>
It is hard to imagine that Amazon 's own skincare products would have to be shunned from now on . <EOS>
Vitamix and Vitamins 6300 <EOS>
I 've been watching for a long time , and I see a discount on the MIA 6300 , and buy the same price overseas in Central Asia , hurry up . <EOS>
The order was placed on September 2 and expected to arrive on the 21st , and the result was that the 12th arrived almost 10 days early . <EOS>
The packaging is not big , it 's straight from the original package of Vitamix , and Amazon isn 't afraid of being washed out to sea ! <EOS>
The machine looks brand new , the accessories are complete , it 's amazing how the cup vibrates on the bottom , I 'm so scared to start it that it goes straight out ! <EOS>
Ask a friend who has 5200 , and listen to him describe it as if I don 't have this luxury . <EOS>
The recipe is all in English , it 's boring , and I can 't find the Chinese version online , which is a hassle ! <EOS>
After receiving the shipment , I bought a transformer in a hurry , and I estimate that it will be ready in three days , when I can fold it ! <EOS>
This purchase was not satisfactory . <EOS>
This is the second time I have purchased a diaper from Amazon , having bought a box when my baby was 2 months old , and opted for European imported paper diapers . <EOS>
But this time I bought an L-numbered diaper , with two separate packages in one box , and when I opened it , I felt that the paper was looser , there was a clear difference between imported diapers and baby wipes . <EOS>
However , after the second set of diapers , a rash appeared immediately on the inside of the baby 's thighs and has not gone away . <EOS>
I suspect two packages in one box are of different quality . <EOS>
I don 't think I should be buying any more ! <EOS>
Where is the anti-counterfeiting logo ? <EOS>
From the outside of the packaging bag , the feeling of thickness is disconcerting , after all , it is a food package that is too simple , and belongs to international purchases , there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting logo , opening the bottle is very easy , The key is that a layer of honey in the lid pops out directly from the inside , with the opening almost no adhesion , foreign products are like this ? <EOS>
I was born in China , so I don 't understand . <EOS>
It 's supposed to be authentic , right ? <EOS>
This is my first time overseas buying here , just writing down my doubts , maybe this is normal ? <EOS>
Producing bad goods , selling bad products , resulting in bad service , buying six watches to give to children , one of which shows a quick number that is incomplete , six pieces of time are not consistent , ten hours apart . <EOS>
Very satisfied , very like , Amazon overseas purchases are genuine without a doubt , the quality is also very good , goods are very cheap , buy reassurance , after-sales service is very thoughtful , customer service attitude is friendly and harmonious , problem handling is patient and efficient , perfectly solved aftercare , accompanying express delivery delivery on the door very convenient and stable , delivery manager is well thought out for customers , every time will remind you in time to pick up goods from the express cabinet , thank Amazon to customers for providing such a comfortable shopping experience . <EOS>
After all , the whole family loves to shop overseas on Amazon ! <EOS>
A bad shopping experience <EOS>
The order at the time of the Black Friday , the result was that I waited a long time and did not receive it , and the next inquiry , that the package had already been signed , I asked my colleagues around me to say that there was no sign , hurry up and contact the courier company , but they said to send the sender in order to initiate an inquisition , contact Amazon customer service , wait for more than ten days , finally find out if the mail was mistakenly sent to someone else , then several times before finally picking up the parcel , outer packaging has been dismantled , goods are still intact , do not know if they have been used or not , it is very bad . <EOS>
Goods from national brands <EOS>
Huawei is a national delicacy . <EOS>
This is a far cry from today 's business climate , which relies on advertising to boost awareness . <EOS>
It 's impossible for a company without power to do this , and it doesn 't dare ! <EOS>
That 's why I chose Huawei . <EOS>
I bought it more than six months ago and it feels good , very good . <EOS>
The reason I didn 't give it a full rating was because one time I had a misalignment while using it to navigate offline , and I ended up not figuring out why , other times it was fine . <EOS>
And it has a good online destination input , automatically designs routes after searching , and after leaving the wifi , it is very useful for automatic offline navigation , without running traffic . <EOS>
I admire you , and I want you to know ! <EOS>
The first factor that determines a person 's job satisfaction is not the salary , but whether the job is given enough attention and appreciation . <EOS>
According to Maslow 's hierarchical theory of needs , after the basic needs of human existence have been satisfied , the most urgent are psychological needs that want to be understood , affirmed , and appreciated . <EOS>
It is true that for most of us , it is hard to express your love in your heart , even if you express it with love , gratitude and appreciation in silence . <EOS>
In the book , the author outlines five languages of appreciation : affirmative words , thoughtful moments , acts of service , grateful gifts , and physical contact . <EOS>
I think it 's important not just to know which five languages you can appreciate , but to be able to express your gratitude in these languages whenever and wherever you are , and to thank the people around you , whether they are family , friends or colleagues . <EOS>
In fact , the closer we are to each other the more appreciation and gratitude we need , and our lives will be better . <EOS>
Learning to appreciate , companies can also retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the rate of resignation . <EOS>
Thank you to the translators for bringing us wonderful foreign ideas and worlds . <EOS>
Due to the cultural context of the Midwest , there are more or less differences between the languages , and the author believes that if he gets a chance to see the original , he will reap more . <EOS>
Thank you again to the authors , translators and editors for their hard work ! <EOS>
Satisfied with the watch <EOS>
It must be genuine , go to the counter to check the excess , the appearance of the watch is very beautiful , precise workmanship , materials , plus imported mechanical movements , so there is a certain fraction , it is those three or four hundred so-called machine watches cannot be compared , this is the real price . <EOS>
The table is very accurate , the error is completely within acceptable limits , there is a jewelry identification certificate in the packaging of the table , and the 12 words on the dial are real diamonds . <EOS>
The Bentley watch is really good . <EOS>
Highly sexualized collections <EOS>
I didn 't know about TASCHEN before , but I bought a lot of their books recently because they were too strong , whether it was the selection or the production itself . <EOS>
There have been three previous editions , the largest of which is almost 50 cm long and 34 cm wide ; the middle version is about 36 cm and 23 cm ; and this edition is the smallest , with a two-volume bookcase . <EOS>
Individuals also find it acceptable , firstly because it is cheap , and more than 700 pages are divided into two , which is better to read as a plain book ; secondly , unlike Michelangelo 's complete collection , the painting is the subject , with the black-and-white manuscript of Da Vinci accounting for the majority , for a budget-limited , non-artistic professional reader , this edition as an appreciation of paintings and manuscripts . <EOS>
2 , the explanation of the painting part is great , there is compositional analysis , draft analysis and historical background ( e.g. Last Supper ) , but I don 't know if it is printing or book size problem , some shadows are too deep in some counties , can not see the details , a bit of regret . <EOS>
In contrast to Michelangelo , Da Vinci 's manuscript is much richer in content . <EOS>
The former is already a genius , while the latter 's reach and achievements are beyond description . <EOS>
If one could only experience half of Da Vinci by looking at a painting , one would be speechless after reading the manuscript . <EOS>
Amazon is looking into suspected counterfeit goods <EOS>
The quality is super-poor , the packaging is loose , there is no portion , even less than the products on the roadside , no kilograms , and no barcode , ten bags of packages are also loosely packed , completely not the characteristics of qualified products ; is Amazon 's worst shopping experience , has requested a refund ; completely belongs to the quality problem ; advises merchants to rub their eyes and refuse substandard goods ; addition : again bought heart prints , supermarket 23 / 10 volumes , added a few contrast photos , further verifying the counterfeit of the product , in order to give consumers a clearer reference , to avoid economic losses and further discomfort ! <EOS>
Once again , it is expected that Amazon will be uncompromising and serious about the source of its goods . <EOS>
Excited <EOS>
I 'm not sure how I felt before I bought it , until I opened it and saw the packaging ! <EOS>
When I finally touched the headphone line , it felt particularly soft and the quality was so good that I couldn 't wait to plug it in and playqq music on my phone . <EOS>
To my amazement , the sound quality was surrounded by 3D ! <EOS>
I asked in a physical call center , almost 30 or so , but it 's definitely not a gourmet brand , it is mixed , so I said that this is worth having , even though it costs 27 bucks , the price is definitely worth it ! <EOS>
I can 't find the official Amazon feed at the moment , so I 'm only able to provide feedback in product reviews . <EOS>
