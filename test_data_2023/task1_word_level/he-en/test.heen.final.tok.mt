What 's your typical Friday look like ? <EOS>
The weekends are the most important moments in my life . Worship and tradition are very deeply rooted in me . Fridays at my house are dedicated to the children , Aaron ( 10 ) and Jonathan ( 8 ) . I pick them up from school , we buy flowers and worshipping supplies , have lunch , and do something fun together , such as play soccer , ride horses , or play board games . Sometimes we go to a beach or even just wash the car , but we always stop on the way to buy a gift at the neighborhood toy store - and there is always another excuse . <EOS>
How 's your Friday dinner ? <EOS>
On my side is a Tunisian kitchen , full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter , music , singing , and joy . On the side of my wife , Ines , who is also an excellent cook , is Ukrainian food , which is deep and spicy , with a lot of meat . When we reach my mother-in-law , amazing smells are already coming from the lobby of her apartment . <EOS>
Do you have any special childhood memories from weekends ? <EOS>
As a child , I used to wake up on Saturdays to the sounds of Israeli music on the G network and the pale explorer westerns , which we knew by heart . My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel , usually up north . Every remote corner of the country made him proud . He passed away three months ago from a serious illness , and for him Kiddush and Saturday were holy days , especially since the whole family should be together . <EOS>
As a zealous Zionist , how do you feel about the holiday ? <EOS>

State comptroller warns : " Central Election Commission is unprepared for cyber threats " <EOS>
• " World War III will be a hacker war but the world is not ready for it " <EOS>
State visitor Metindjo Engelman attended Tel Aviv University 's annual cyber conference today ( Wednesday ) and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel . " We are exposed . Our data is visible to too many people . <EOS>
In the past year , we have conducted penetration checks at the Jerusalem Traffic Management Center , hospitals , and the tax authorities ' systems . We found significant deficiencies in the reviews , including the fact that very few of them were conducted by public bodies , some of which carried out penetrators during the review . In addition , there were weaknesses in Central Election Committee 's readiness for cyber threats . <EOS>
We at the State Comptroller 's Office are committed to continuing to address this significant issue better than you , for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world , he concluded . <EOS>
We looked : What do the side effects of the coronavirus vaccine mean ? <EOS>
• Could this indicate a stronger immune system in those who do experience these symptoms , or is it just an unfounded rumor ? <EOS>
While more and more people are getting vaccinated , the lack of information about side effects continues to confuse and create rumors , most of which are false . Is the immune system of those who have developed adverse reactions stronger than those whose bodies have responded less severely to the vaccine , perhaps proving that their system is unable to fight off a foreign body entering the body ? <EOS>
There are several levels of responses to the vaccine , says Dr. David Devere , chief of primary care at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a member of the CDC 's Advisory Committee on Epidemiology . <EOS>
Is there a link between the levels of antibodies you develop and the side effects ? <EOS>
There is no correlation between feelings and the development of antibodies to the virus . About 60 to 50 percent experience side effects , but about 90 percent develop anti-virus defenses . People who develop stronger responses are not found to be more protected . <EOS>
There is no correlation in the medical literature between immediate response and vaccine levels . In some trials in which people also received placebo vaccines , a quarter developed headaches . It is also a psychological factor - how the person responds to the vaccination , whether he expects side effects . Many of the side-effects could have occurred normally , but because the public is immune , it attributes the response to vaccinations themselves , and this is a misconception that we see about vaccining in general - the attribution of adverse events that occur near and attributable to it . <EOS>
There are all sorts of theories on the subject , but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine . One theory is that it is a strong immune response . <EOS>
Is there even a way to gauge the strength of an immune system ? <EOS>
When students were exposed to the flu virus , they showed that those who didn 't sleep or were under higher stress were more vulnerable to infection . In addition , there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components . When there 's a decline in immunity , you see it right away . People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases . It is not that someone is walking around with a weak immune systems and not aware of it . <EOS>
Their effectiveness is that the substance stays in the body for a short period of time - enters , does its work , and then breaks down . This technology is not new , but it has received a serious boost due to the tremendous need for rapid vaccination . Now , for example , we know that a three-week gap between doses is small and some of the vaccine experts say that after a third dose we may not need another one anytime soon , so it 's unclear whether we 're going to get a vaccines of more than a year or a very large half-thirds " . <EOS>

The emphasis was on finding a successor to Shmuel , the so-called " king of kings and one of a kind " , and other titles designed to make clear how perfect and unique he is . The result was a heightened level of difficulty . <EOS>
They will say that it is a sports program that encourages physical activity and presents overcoming difficulties and challenges , but to the vast majority of viewers - average chair bats like us - " Ninja Israel " cultivates for us a model of athletic achievement unimaginable - faster , stronger , taller , more perfect . <EOS>
Exemption from quarantine for vaccinated and recovering non-red countries , foreign tourists returning <EOS>
Arrivals in the country have received notifications from the Ministry of Health that they are exempt from quarantine if they receive a negative response to a coronavirus test • Only then did the ministry issue an official announcement that only travelers from orange countries are concerned , although returnees from red countries have also reported receiving the notification • In addition : tourists from Orange destinations will be able to enter the Country and many of the Red Destinations are expected to be taken off the list <EOS>
At the height of the pandemic - the end of isolation for returnees from abroad ? The Ministry of Health sent this morning ( Tuesday ) messages to those returning to Israel , stating that they are exempt from quarantine if they receive a negative response to the coronavirus test they took after landing in Israel . <EOS>
Some of the messages sent out told returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative answer or after 24 hours at the latest , and some of them received the exemption after getting the negative response . <EOS>
Only then did an official announcement come out from the Ministry of Health stating that starting at midnight , 4.1.2022 , vaccinated or cured , returnees from orange countries will undergo a PCR test and go into isolation for 24 hours or until a negative result is received ( the earliest of them ) . The decision will be anchored in the order of the Health Ministry Director General and brought for approval by the Knesset Health Committee . <EOS>
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovering travelers who have already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they performed upon entering Israel , will end their quarantine tonight at midnight and are not required to undergo a second test . However , passengers from red countries reported that they also received the notice . <EOS>
Anyone who has not been vaccinated or recovered and returns from an orange country , will go into home isolation for 14 days , with the possibility of shortening the quarantine with a negative result in a PCR test carried out starting from the 7th day of landing in Israel ( landing day is the first day ) . <EOS>
The decision to lift most of the restrictions on flights and especially on the vaccinated comes a day before a meeting at the BGTC presented by the association of travel agencies , the headquarters for open skies and the hotel associations . At the meeting tomorrow , petitioners are expected to demand the removal of all other countries from the red list , with Professor Itamar Grotto backing them in his opinion . <EOS>
Even foreigners can come in . <EOS>
The Prime Minister and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs , Health , Interior , Tourism and Transport agreed that starting on Sunday , January 9 , 2022 , vaccinated / recovered foreigners ( as defined by the Ministry of Health ) from orange countries will be allowed to enter - this is subject to filling out an online form in advance , taking a PCR or antigen test before boarding the plane , performing a PSR test upon entry into Israel and then entering quarantine for 24 hours or receiving my test response ( the earliest of these ) . <EOS>
Non-vaccinated / non-recovered foreigners ( as defined by the Ministry of Health ) will not be allowed to enter Israel . Foreigners from red countries , except those who have been approved for entry by a Committee of Exceptions , will be prohibited . <EOS>
[ Tweeting ] <EOS>
What about the red states ? <EOS>
The Committee on Country Classification at the Ministry of Health recommends to the government that the Committee recommend removing from the red list of countries and moving to orange list the countries : South Africa , Hungary , Nigeria , Spain , Portugal , France , Canada . <EOS>
The remaining countries on the red list at this point are the United Arab Emirates , the US , Ethiopia , United Kingdom , Tanzania , Mexico , Switzerland and Turkey . <EOS>
Another option being considered by the Ministry of Health is to exempt vaccinated people returning from red countries from quarantine . At the moment , it is unclear whether there is a connection between the messages received this morning by returnees to Israel and the guidelines that may be accepted by Health Ministry on this issue . <EOS>
There 's been no response from the health department . <EOS>
Protected Housing Association v. Ruthie Rousseau : " Saying ' this tastes like protected housing ' is hurting our business " . <EOS>
Chairwoman Julie Geth wrote a letter expressing the union 's complaint against what they claimed was an offensive statement by a " Next Restaurant " judge in one of the trailers for the show . • Ruthie Russo responded : " Glad there are places that invest more in the cuisine of this population " . <EOS>
Association of Nursing Homes and Protected Housing in Israel against " The Next Restaurant " : In a letter sent to Israel Today by chairwoman Yuli Geth , it is written : " In the pre-show preview , which was distributed on all social networks and television , the professional judge of the competition is described as saying ' Food tastes like protected housing ' , i.e. food from a closed establishment with low-quality food " . <EOS>
The tone chosen by the show 's judge , Ruthie Rousseau , to describe her disappointment with the food that the contestant has filed to cancel our long-standing campaign to fight ignorance in the area is because the sheltered housing units operate in different houses restaurants for the benefit of the tenants with top-notch chef meals . <EOS>
In Israel in recent years , more and more families and older people are realizing that loneliness is the most serious illness in old age and are seeing community settings as a proven solution to the disease . <EOS>
Food is one of the greatest pleasures in life , so we dedicate resources and efforts to provide residents with the finest food . Most shelters are assisted by professional chefs to create a menu . We would be happy at any time to invite the judging panel to be impressed at the winning dishes served every day to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel and on behalf of chefs and restaurant crews in the safe houses we ask for your apology and clarification . <EOS>
Ruthie Rousseau commented : " I 'm glad there are places that invest more in the cuisine of this population , who definitely deserve great food in their later years . I respect the hard work of chefs , butchers , nurses and cooks everywhere , including safe housing " . <EOS>

Gantz revealed : " Iran and Hezbollah worked together to undermine UNICEF 's activities in Lebanon " . <EOS>
The Minister of Defense attended the International Cyber Conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that " Israel knows the cyber systems of its rivals and their methods of operation • Gantz referred , among other things , to the documentation of al-Said in Hamas captivity : " A video aimed at extortion on top of a humanitarian issue " • A deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed , " We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems " <EOS>
Defense Minister Benny Gantz addressed the International Cyber Conference of the Cyber Center at the University of Tehran this morning where he exposed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to hit UNIFIL forces in Lebanon , " another hit by the Iranian and Hizballah on Lebanese civilians and the stability of Lebanon " , Gantza said . <EOS>
Gantz referred , among other things , to the documentation of Hamas captive Hisham al-Sayed in Gaza , released by the terrorist group 's military wing : " Yesterday a video was released aimed at extortion on the back of a humanitarian issue . Hamas is holding the four boys hostage in violation of international law , contrary to morality . <EOS>
He added that " the State of Israel is acting by various means , and continues to turn every stone to bring the boys home . As we have said before This is a humanitarian issue , that is how we see it , on this basis we will continue to act . <EOS>
He further revealed a joint activity of Iran and Hezbollah : " Iran is also activating its disruption in the cyber dimension : I can reveal today , that the Iranian security forces have recently identified activity in collaboration with Hizballah , to undermine the activities of the UNIFIL forces in Lebanon . This is by carrying out a cyber operation whose purpose was to steal materials on the preparations of UNFIL in space , and use them by Hizbullah . <EOS>
Israel knows the cyber systems of its rivals and their methods of operation . We have seen in recent years a phenomenon of Iranian hacking groups , operating against Israel and other countries , Gantz continued and said . " ' The new missions ' are terrorists with their own keyboard like the fighters of other terrorist organizations . <EOS>
Gantz went on to attack the nuclear power : " Iran is leading cyber terrorism and making moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments , as happened in the US presidential election and other attempts that Israel is aware of . Actions such as that of the ' Shahid Awaah ' unit that collected information on ships , fuel stations and industrial plants in several countries , were done under the direct directive of Iran 's leadership and the Revolutionary Guards as revealed by the investigations " . <EOS>
He added that " in recent years there have been many attempts to break into private and public companies , both at home and abroad . I also call on the public to demand ' cyber-responsibility ' , and punish companies and bodies that do not act according to guidelines " . <EOS>
Gantz went on to outline Israel 's next goals against threats : " Our top mission , in the military , industries and various security organizations , is to build people , train them , and keep them . The Chief of Staff and I have positioned this issue as one of the central tasks in relevant units . We are examining force building all the time both in terms of manpower , training and missions . In the coming years we will also have to examine the form of organization , management and operation of cyberwarfare , on its offensive and strategic characteristics in IL and the security system as a whole . <EOS>
Finally , the defense minister summed up and called for cooperation with the world : " It is of great importance that we cooperate against Iran in the cyber dimension as well . The same cooperation we are building with Iran is also expanding in cyber " . <EOS>
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed , " We foiled an attempt to poison the water systems " . <EOS>
Uri , the deputy commander of Unit 8200 , said in the unit 's first public appearance at such conferences , revealed that Israel had foiled an attack on the water systems . <EOS>
The frustration of cyber threats is a central part of our activities . Our goal is to gain superiority over the attacker , to successfully identify him and to act to eliminate his capabilities . A deputy 8200 commander said , adding , " So sometimes we also find victims outside Israel and then we contact other agencies if necessary . We do this both independently and by collaborating with industry and other organizations , through the implementation and use of tools we have developed . <EOS>
We thwarted an attempt to seize and poison Israel 's critical water systems several years ago . In another case , we also identified that a particular adversary had attacked Israel and in doing so we recognized that the same attacker had also tried to target U.S. power plants . This was the first indication of this attack . <EOS>
That 's why the prevalence of corticosteroid eye disease is so high in the South . <EOS>
A study found a link between the development of the disease and close marriages • The highest incidence was found in the Bedouin sector • Expert : " It is possible that in any sector with a high number of weddings between cousins , there is a higher prevalence of disease " <EOS>
In recent years , several studies have been conducted that help to understand how the disease develops , and innovative treatments developed . The new research provides a research basis to suspect that corticosteroid eye disease is a genetic disease . <EOS>
A recent study on the transformation of a corneal shape from a forced one to an engraved one found that the cause of disease and weakness of the cornea and distortion of its shape is related to enzymatic imbalance , whereby free radicals can damage the proteins in the kornea - and its structure will change . The source of this enzyme deficiency is genetic , a fact that strengthens the hypothesis that corticosteroids are an inherited disease . <EOS>
According to Professor Ariella Gordon-Shag , head of the Department of Optometry Sciences at the Hadassah Academic College , " In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa , a prevalence of keratoconus was found to be 3.2 % . <EOS>
The researcher adds that this finding is not surprising : " There is a high prevalence of cartoconus in the Bedouin sector . In our studies , we found that close marriages are a risk factor for the disease . <EOS>
In this context , it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unambiguous conclusion : in cases where there is a family history of CKD , all family members should have an appropriate eye exam as soon as possible . <EOS>
According to Erza Proctor , a B.Sc. clinical optometrist , " there are ten times as many visits to the clinic from remote peripheral areas , especially the southern area , as the center " . <EOS>
Over the past decade , Procter adds , " I have noticed that most patients are turning away from the periphery , especially from Beersheba . This is mainly due to the high prevalence of marriages within the family ( especially in the Bedouin sector ) and various allergies , and a lack of awareness of proper treatment of the problem " . <EOS>
Procter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or in the late teens ( ages 16-15 or 20 ) . <EOS>
However , the disease may also progress at a rapid pace and peak within a few months . Many of the patients also report increased sensitivity to light . <EOS>
Medical negligence at different stages of labor <EOS>
In order to win damages , the plaintiffs must prove , in addition to negligence , that the damage was caused by neglect . <EOS>
Childbirth is one of the most joyous and exciting events in a family 's life , but unfortunately , sometimes births end in serious birth defects or miscarriages as a result of medical negligence . <EOS>
In cases where the birth ended with a physical injury , to the child or the mother , there is room for examination of the sequence of events that resulted in the injury and even for considering seeking legal advice . A lawyer specializing in medical malpractice will examine whether there were defects in conduct by the medical staff at the various stages of birth that caused the damage and , where appropriate , seek the advice of a medical expert in a relevant field . <EOS>
It should be emphasized that not every medical error amounts to negligence ( in the legal sense of the term ) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily teach that the procedure was negligent . When , then , is the case ? <EOS>
In this article , we will examine the different stages of childbirth , explain what complications may occur at each stage and when they amount to medical negligence . <EOS>
The axis phase <EOS>
At this stage , the cervix gradually opens ( to allow the passage of the fetus at birth ) and at the end the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters . Most cases of medical negligence during the incision stage involve the failure to identify fetal distress towards birth , which causes damage to the unborn child , sometimes manifested even in cerebral palsy . <EOS>
Cerebral palsy : <EOS>
Cerebral palsy may be caused by a lack of recognition or delay in the detection of a subconjunctival aspiration , which is manifested by failure to supply oxygen to the fetus ' brain tissue . Generally , monitoring the condition of the newborn and correctly decoding the monitor monitoring fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of development of foetal distress , allowing the medical team to act quickly and rescue the infant before it is irreversibly injured . Cases in which medical staff ignore indications that the foetus suffers from a deficiency in prognosis or the team incorrectly interprets the data in its possession and in particular the working monitor or a response to a finding in a hospital for the prevention of malnutrition . <EOS>
Cerebral palsy can also be caused by a fall from the umbilical cord and by an unidentified rupture of the uterus . Even in these severe cases , it is important to determine whether the medical team acted appropriately . <EOS>
For example , attorney Anna Reif Ligenza , of the financial firm Cerro & Co . , which specializes in representing medical malpractice victims , relates that her office handled a lawsuit of a child who was injured during birth after the midwife kicked the umbilical sac when the fetal head was too high , thereby causing a falling cord ( when the cord precedes the baby 's head ) and impaired oxygen supply to the foetal brain ( as a result of pressure from the brain on the navel cord ) , resulting in a baby being born with severe neurological damage . <EOS>
In another case , a lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to serious medical negligence by the staff of a maternity ward in a large hospital who during the birth did not recognize at the time clear signs that should have led to a real suspicion that the newborn suffers from a tear of the uterus in the surgical scar area of her previous pregnancy . The fetus that escaped through the rupture into the abdominal cavity suffered from severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage on the verge of death . <EOS>
It should be emphasized that in order to obtain compensation , the plaintiffs must prove , in addition to negligence , that there is a causal link between the neglect of the medical staff that caused the breastfeeding to be undetected and the harm caused to the child , i.e. that the damage was caused by the aforementioned carelessness and not by any other cause or factor . The examination of causation will be carried out by examining medical indicators that , according to medical literature , only in their existence is there a cause-and-effect relationship between lactation and brain damage . <EOS>
The death of the fetus <EOS>
The company was founded in 1895 in Turin by Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi <EOS>
The active stage of labor <EOS>
The active stage of labor begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 4 inches [ 10 cm ] and ends with the birth of a baby . <EOS>
Pregnancy and the Avoidance of C-section <EOS>
In some cases , a dysfunctional birth develops , which is the lack of progression of the active birth process . In such cases a caesarean section is usually performed , in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to delayed birth . <EOS>
There are instances where failure to perform a cesarean on time can cause irreversible harm to the fetus , explained attorney Rafe-Lingenza . " For example , we have handled a medical malpractice case involving the death of a newborn resulting from a significant delay in having a caesarian . <EOS>
Carelessly giving birth to a vacuum <EOS>
In situations where there is a significant danger to the mother or fetus requiring a particularly rapid termination of labor , a vacuum delivery is sometimes performed . This process involves placing a " dope " on the foetus 's head and forcibly pulling it out . Naturally , this action is hazardous and can cause harm to both the embryo and the woman giving birth and therefore requires great care , precision , and skill . <EOS>
In these cases , medical negligence may be manifested by the physician not following the mandatory guidelines and performing the operation despite the existence of a contraindication , such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis , or performs it for too long or when despite several failed attempts the doctor continues and repeats the procedure more than the allowed number of times . <EOS>
Paralysis in the name of ERB <EOS>
Paralysis is caused by congenital nerve damage to the brachial plexus ( a network of nerves that connects the spine and the upper part of the shoulder ) and when it occurs during childbirth it is advisable to check whether the damage occurred as a result of negligence by the delivery team . The damage is manifested by weakness of muscles in the hand and can reach complete paralysus of all the arm . <EOS>
When should you suspect paralysis as a result of medical negligence ? In cases where a weight assessment of the fetus indicates that it is a chromosomal foetus , i.e. expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kg and according to the guidelines , a caesarean delivery is preferable . When the child 's weight is greater than 4 kg , Caesarian should be considered in light of risk factors including gestational diabetes and the length of second stage of labor . <EOS>
Indeed , in 2694 / 90 B.C.E. , the Supreme Court ruled that " the risk of shoulder formation during birth can be predicted in advance with some degree of accuracy , and the way to prevent the formation , where it is likely to occur , is by cesarean section " . <EOS>
Exit phase of the placenta <EOS>
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of a womb after the delivery and is accompanied by bleeding . The process usually lasts for up to half an hour from when the baby is delivered and often happens spontaneously , without the involvement of medical staff . <EOS>
During this stage , complications can occur that can cause serious damage to the fetus . One known complication due to uterine fibroids is called " Ashman 's syndrome " , the abnormal scarring of the womb resulting from inflammation caused by excessive fibrosis , a phenomenon that affects the cervix in a way that does not allow the pregnancy to proceed . <EOS>
Death at birth <EOS>
In these cases , the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family turns , unfortunately , into the most tragic event for it . <EOS>
For example , attorney Reif-Lingenza told us , " our firm filed a case involving the death of a newborn , where in that case the medical staff ignored and failed to respond to the worrisome vital signs of the birth , for long hours , and delayed the diagnosis of massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of her underlying disease " . <EOS>
In another case , explained attorney Reif-Lingenza , " our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after giving birth to twins as a result of bleeding from an improperly sewn caesarean section . In that case the woman complained of severe pain and weakness after surgery , but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and her clinical condition , responding only late after her body systems began to collapse , which led to her death " . <EOS>
Loss of uterus <EOS>
In serious cases , medical negligence at birth can lead to a hysterectomy , says lawyer Rafe Lingeza : " Our firm filed a lawsuit against a hospital on the grounds that it removed a uterus because of medical malpractice after childbirth . In that case , the woman , a 31-year-old , lost her womb due to inadequate treatment of massive bleeding observed by the medical team after birth and yet no timely action was taken to prevent the damage " . <EOS>
What are the compensation claims for medical negligence in childbirth ? <EOS>
Childbirth compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components , with the most significant amounts being for pain and suffering , nursing and wage treatment , loss of wages and pensions to the victim and even to his parents and other damages . Compensation terminated to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the household . <EOS>
The amount of compensation is determined on a case-by-case basis for the child and his or her circumstances , says attorney Reif-Lingenza . She adds that " today , most medical malpractice claims are settled in a compromise that weighs the likelihood and risk of each party in the proceedings " , adding , however , " there are cases where the case ends only with a verdict , where if the lawsuit is not dismissed , the plaintiffs will receive full damages for all of their losses and , for example , as part of a second claim from the Office of the Attorney General to the Court of Appeals , which ruled that the defendant could be compensated for a loss of tens of millions of dollars " . <EOS>
In Summary <EOS>
Medical malpractice in childbirth is undoubtedly every family 's nightmare . In such cases , a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that led to the tragic outcome , by an attorney skilled in handling medical negligence claims , can help you win the compensation you deserve . <EOS>
The surgeon ruptured the heart and the patient died . <EOS>
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Fars Abu-Aker as director of the hospital 's chest surgery unit • The chairman of a medical committee complained that the director , Dr Angell , was warned before his appointment • Hospital : " He is valued and experienced " <EOS>
A terrible mistake was made at Wolfson State Hospital in Holon , when during an operation the doctor tore open the patient 's heart , leading to his tragic death . <EOS>
The operation on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient was performed on April 19 . It was the first operation performed by Dr. Pras Abu-Aker at the hospital after his appointment as director of the chest surgery unit at Wolfson . During the operation , which was designed to drain the area surrounding the patient 's heart , the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart that led to severe bleeding and caused death . <EOS>
However , the unusual complication opened a Pandora 's box , which raised serious questions regarding the management of the hospital . The Director of Oncology Institute and Chairman of Medical Committee , Dr. Ronen Brenner , demanded an investigation into the matter in a letter he forwarded to the Hospital Administrator , Drs. Anat Angell . <EOS>
A giant hole in the heart <EOS>
According to Dr. Brenner 's letter , the patient had been sober , functioning , and being treated by his hand for the past four years . Recently , his disease had spread and an abnormal accumulation of fluid was found inside the atrium , where the heart muscle is located . Also , surgeon dr . Abu Akkar was impressed that he could perform the operation . <EOS>
According to the complaint , a serious malfunction occurred in the operation , and Dr. Hagi Dekal , director of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Wolfson , who was at the time operating on a child in an adjacent room , " was rushed to an operating table and saw a huge hole in his heart " . He said the heart was emptied of blood , the blood pressure was zero and the surgical approach was wrong . <EOS>
The sister band was created to continue the shows in the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of the Hall of Fame . <EOS>
Additionally , Dr. Brenner said that Dekel approached him and told him that he was not professionally and personally suited to manage a chest surgery unit at Wolfson . However , despite his explicit warnings and even though he should have been the chest surgeon 's direct manager , Engel made a bid without sharing it and accepted D.A. for the position . <EOS>
Another noted : " It is a simple procedure , lasting only a few minutes " , adding , " One cannot ignore the flawed process of hiring Dr. Abu Akkar . The question arises as to whether there is direct responsibility on the part of Engel for the failure of the operation and the patient 's death " . <EOS>
An experienced surgeon <EOS>
Israel Today was presented with information and statements from other senior doctors that reinforce the questions raised in Dr. Ron Brenner 's case . <EOS>
Dr. Mordechai Shamounov , director of surgery at A. Wolfson , responded to Brenner 's complaint , writing that Abu Akkar is " one of the most experienced surgeons in the country , but a relatively young breast-surgeon " . He also added that he was selected in a proper auction and that Dackel did not take part in it , in line with his statements about his desire to " disengage " from the chest unit . <EOS>

Dr. Shamounov writes that since he started work on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days ' grace , " all the doctors at the hospital have been impressed by his professionalism , motivation and willingness to work . He has performed dozens of similar procedures , and unfortunately the present case ended as it did " . <EOS>
The Wolfson Hospital said in a statement : " We share the family 's grief . This is the patient of oncologist Dr. Ron Brenner . The breast surgeon mentioned in the article is a respected and long-time surgical practitioner , and he has been selected by a tender to manage the Breast Surgery Unit affiliated with the Department of surgery at Wolfsburg Hospital . <EOS>
According to Dr. Haji Dackel , his quotes are inaccurate and out of context . It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very critical condition . The hospital is investigating the details of the case transparently , and the Ministry of Health is aware of these details . <EOS>
Electricity in your pocket : The cost of not closing coal plants in June - one billion dollars <EOS>
Report of the Knesset Research and Information Center : Failure to close coal-fired power plants by the June 2022 deadline is estimated at NIS 1 billion . • Electricity company : " Fuel use policy is written first and foremost by Ministry of Energy " <EOS>
The economic cost of not closing coal plants by the June 2022 deadline is estimated at NIS 1 billion for 2022 , according to a report from the Knesset Research and Information Center . <EOS>
According to the report , this cost is reflected in the price of electricity to consumers , which is expected to rise in coming months due to higher coal prices . <EOS>
In addition , an additional excess of about 900,000 tons of coal is expected to be used in 2023 , resulting in additional costs to the electricity industry from the non-closure of the power plants , assuming that the price of natural gas remains significantly lower than that of charcoal . <EOS>
The report said that a reduction of about a billion shekels in electricity tariffs in 2022 would mean a 4 percent decrease in the rate of consumption for households . <EOS>
During the Winter War ( explosed on November 30th , 1939 ) the U.S. U.S. U.S. piloted a D.XXI poker battle plane . Our first air victory was recorded on December 19th , 1939 , after an U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.

It should be noted that as part of the electricity reform , it was decided , among other things , to establish a subsidiary of Electricity Corporation , which would set up natural gas-fired units , designed to replace the 4-1 carbon units at the Ravin Lights site . <EOS>
Following this decision , a government resolution was adopted in July 2018 , stating that the 4-1 coal-fired generating units at the Ural Rabin power plant should cease operations . Timelines were set by the resolution , so that construction of the first unit on natural gas will start in January 2020 and operation will begin in June 2022 , and accordingly , the four-1 COG units will also stop operating at that time . <EOS>
In response , the electricity company said : " Fuel use policy is written first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy . In accordance with the decisions of the ministry , a policy of reducing coal use to the minimum possible has been implemented in Israel for several years even when the price of charcoal is lower than that of gas " . <EOS>
A travel warning to Istanbul : Surprising news for Israelis from Turkish Airlines <EOS>
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change the destination or time of their flight . <EOS>
News for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning : Airlines will allow flight times to be changed . <EOS>
Reminder : Earlier this week the Counter-Terrorism Headquarters raised the severity of the travel warning to Istanbul to level four . This is the highest level and means " High threat level : Do not enter this country and in case of stay , leave the country as soon as possible " . <EOS>
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have announced that they will allow Israelis who booked their flight before the travel warning was issued , i.e. before 13.6.22 , to change their destination or flight time . <EOS>
Tourism Minister Rezabozov said : " Israeli citizens should not have to pay an economic price because of terrorist threats . I am glad that major airlines like Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have responded to our request and I hope that other companies will give a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their holidays in Turkey due to the severe travel warning " . <EOS>
With an investment of 200 million shekels , the new resort will open near Lard . <EOS>
The Desert Flourishes : Another luxury hotel due to open in three years • Chef restaurants , private swimming pools , and 110 rooms are just a small part of what the hotel has to offer • All details in this article <EOS>
They were involved in 14 eastern eastern states and their allies under the leadership of the Soviet Union , which initiated the invasion of the eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern eastern easters . <EOS>
7MINDS from Beit Fatal and the White City Real Estate Company have jointly purchased a plot of land covering about 20 acres in the Judean Desert , where they will build a luxury resort with an investment of about 200 million shekels . The hotel will be built on the same land where a hotel was built by her that was demolished about a year ago . <EOS>
The resort will open in just three years and will have 110 rooms , some of which will feature private pools . The hotel will also have three communal pool , spa , chef restaurants , entertainment complex , gym and more . <EOS>
Responsible for the culinary side of the hotel will be Chef Ren Samoli of Klaro Restaurant , who will build the menu , which is expected to have a unique concept from the resort . <EOS>
The mayor of Arad , Attorney-at-Law Nissan Ben Hamo , congratulated the project : " The decision to build a new and luxurious hotel in the vicinity of Erad gives the official seal of approval to the amazing contribution that Erade has made to tourism in recent years . I am proud of the choice made by the entrepreneurs and convinced that it will be a joint success as it unlocks enormous tourist potential " . <EOS>
Police official : " Government policy and goal setting are required " <EOS>
The Israeli police have launched an operation to evict illegal residents , but there is still a long way to go . <EOS>
If you want to deal with the phenomenon of illegal residents , you need a government policy , from which you have to define goals , tasks and responsibilities . Today there is no single factor in the State of Israel that includes all this issue , a senior police official tells Israel Today . <EOS>
Until a month and a half ago , before the security situation worsened , the phenomenon was manifested by 20,000 to 30,000 Palestinians entering daily through breaches in the fence . <EOS>
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War , and the number of permits in each branch is limited to a cap that determines the political rank according to the security , economic and political situation in the State of Israel . Permits are issued by the IDF through the Directorate of Coordination and Liaison . <EOS>
It should be emphasized that while the perpetrators of the attacks in Ariel , Dizengoff , and Balad were considered terrorists , they were not under surveillance because they had not previously been convicted of any criminal offense that required security forces to monitor their movements . " Therefore , there is no point in their entering through the breaches in the fence " , says a senior security official . <EOS>
Thousands of arrests <EOS>
About 600 of them were investigated and opened criminal cases , and about 200 were imprisoned . According to the policy of the police prosecution , proceedings against illegal residents are carried out only against targeted criminals or repeat offenders ( recidivists ) . <EOS>
According to the law , if an illegal resident is caught within 50 to 100 meters of each side of the separation fence , treatment is carried out by the military prosecutor . Data received by Israel Today shows that in 2021 40,010 illegal residents , travelers and passengers were treated by police . <EOS>
The number of employers , commuters and passengers treated by the police in 2021 was 6,537 . 469 were arrested , and 5,640 criminal cases were opened . " The foundations of the praise phenomenon do not depend on police , the IDF , Israeli society or Palestinian society . They are dependent on other factors " , says a law enforcement official . <EOS>
Legal sources claim that the decision to charge a fine only began with his third arrest , partly because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests being made every day . " He who examines the punishment will find that it is not deterrent " . <EOS>
There 's a lot of complexity . <EOS>
A fugitive , says a police official , " is a complex person . He may be a family man who comes to the country to work to earn a few shekels and come back . It 's the basic platform , and many types of fugitives who come to commit crimes or attacks wear it " . <EOS>
In the past , 16-year-old illegal residents have been caught by police , and even children as young as 8 and 10 are sent by their parents to roadside junctions to earn a few shekels a day . " It also complicates matters , because in such cases we have to bring the parents in and charge them with negligence " , says a senior police officer . <EOS>
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual jobs . The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work . In the past there were also local authorities employing inhabitants in garbage collection , mainly in the north . <EOS>
Of the 34 crossing points , there are about 18 main ones . There are vehicles and goods crossings , some passages that only people pass through and others that are both as well . All the passes are controlled by the IDF and the Transit Authority . <EOS>
There are those who do it for a living and there are gangs whose main occupation is transporting people , says a senior police official , " usually mostly Israeli Arabs , who speak the same language and correspond with them . It can be as much as 100 shekels to 300 shillings per person . Registered companies don 't do this , because if the company is caught , it will be shut down " . <EOS>
A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with the license and insurance , who picks up Palestinians at orderly points and at fixed hours , including by ordered appointment , does not break the law , says a senior police official , " Those who know they are pickup trucks , usually pick them up overnight at hidden points including unloading at concealed points . Most of these guys drive with a vehicle from Azukem because they know that they will be confiscated their vehicle and they prefer to drive in an old one " . <EOS>

Extremely high rate of infection • Positive rate - 11.3 % • Promotes more than 2 infections • Due to overcrowding : In Odessa , preparations are underway to open the third coronavirus ward <EOS>
The omicron pandemic is raging and the overcrowding is already being felt in hospitals : 37,847 people were diagnosed yesterday ( Monday ) with coronavirus . This is according to data published this morning on the website of the Ministry of Health , as of 10 : 00 a.m. <EOS>
Out of 359,628 tests yesterday - 11.38 percent were positive . There are currently 185,753 active carriers in Israel . In terms of hospitalization data , 247 patients are in critical condition and 59 of them are breathing . <EOS>
Remember , yesterday the data presentation changed , and the verified ones include those who passed PCR tests in addition to the infected that passed institutional antigen testing . <EOS>
The Hadassah Medical Center reported this morning that 63 patients are hospitalized in two coronavirus wards in Ankaram . Among the patients , six are in critical ( respiratory ) condition and 18 in a critical condition . The hospital noted that " two coronavirus Wards are fully injected , and our teams are already preparing a third coronavirus ward " . <EOS>
148,503 people are in isolation ( 36,817 were added yesterday ) . 3,743 medical staff are isolated , including 542 doctors . Another 1,008 isolates are brothers and sisters , and 2,193 from other professions . <EOS>

The players and management embraced coach Yannis Sporopoulos who looked very excited at the end . The opener and the laser beam poured water with enthusiasm on Derrick Williams who excelled in the game , and also the rest of the club smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure was released after the last losing streak . <EOS>
They , too , feared defeat by a great opponent who would further undermine the system . <EOS>
There 's an incredible connection between Yannis and me in the locker room , Oz Blazer said . " We know it wasn 't easy for him either , a lot of pressure was released . We 've been looking forward to it , even the way we played . <EOS>
His words had a big impact on how we came out and played on the court , Maccabi players said . <EOS>
I believe this game will change the momentum for us , added Blazer . " We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes and we didn 't break . <EOS>
In the last games we were under a lot of pressure , Yanis told us that if we are released we will win these games . I believe that this victory will take us forward . Many eyes on us and this was the feeling of the whole world against us , I am proud to go into this war , we disconnect everything around and look only at ourselves . <EOS>

Double standards : In Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn 't ? : Nick Cave responds to criticism <EOS>
The singer responded to criticism from a Turkish fan , who accused him of double standards . • Singer in response : " The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict " <EOS>
In doing so , the esteemed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop , Green Day , and Franz Ferdinand , who had also canceled shows in the invading country . But in Kiev 's case , his cancellation notice took a slightly different turn . A Turkish fan named Ahmet Temir is a fan of his painting , as in 2017 he refused to cancel two concerts in Israel , despite much criticism from pro-Palestinian organizations . <EOS>
During his visit to Israel , then-Kayev told local media : " In the end , I 'm here for two reasons : the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis , the second reason being that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians " . <EOS>
What bothers me about your post on Ukraine , Ahmed wrote . " is that you didn 't support the Palestinians in this way , who are also suffering from a brutal regime . In fact , you described Israel as a functioning democracy , but in my opinion Israel is first and foremost responsible for Palestinian suffering . This makes me very sad , because you represent a double standard here " , the Turkish fan concluded . <EOS>
But the story doesn 't end there , as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmed in a long and detailed letter , in which he emphasized that " Russia 's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians . The first situation is an unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor , hoping to change the security order of the whole of Europe . <EOS>
But this is no time for arguments , Akhmet , the singer explained , " this is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians , whose land is currently undergoing a catastrophe . I have great fans in Russia , and I know many Russians are strongly opposed to the actions of the Putin regime . If I could play for them - I would " . <EOS>

Three Asian bridal puppies have recently arrived in the Islamic Republic of Iran . This is a rare birth , which only slightly improves the tragic situation of the endangered animal in that country due to forms , hunters and fatal road accidents . <EOS>
It is worth noting that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where bridesmaids still live in nature . <EOS>
Iran 's IRNA news agency reported that the veterinary team , the Turhan National Park Trust in northern Samnan province , decided to have a caesarean birth in captivity . It also said that less than 20 bridesmaids had recently been documented in seven different provinces of the country . <EOS>
Due to the threat of extinction , the UN implemented a protection program for them back in 2001 . Now , in Iran , it is hoped that the new arrivals could lead to a future increase in the brindle population . <EOS>
Last January , Iran 's Deputy Minister of Environment Hassan Akbari said that the brothel population in the country had dropped dramatically from 100 in 2010 to just 12 . <EOS>
Their situation is extremely serious , Akbari said , noting that bridesmaids have fallen victim to drought in their habitat , hunting and even road accidents . <EOS>

Consider moving from Pinza operations to a full-scale operation . <EOS>
Israel needs to ask itself , again , if it is wrong to change its policy towards the Jenin Strip . • During Ramadan , Israel refrained from doing so , fearing that Genin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank in its wake . <EOS>
At the head of them , as always , are the terrorists , who are concentrating a special effort on trying to preserve the violent atmosphere of recent weeks . Evidence of this is seen during the arrest operation in which an IDF soldier was killed yesterday , R.S.B. Rahim Raza J.L. Fighters who participated in the battle in Jenin testified that they are not such gunmen and that the weapons of terrorism should not only be used on the ground , but also in combat . <EOS>
This forces Israel to ask itself , again , if it is not right to change policy towards the Jenin Strip , and to move from small , intelligence-based Pinzette operations to a large , mass based operation . During Ramadan Israel refrained from doing so , fearing that Genin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena in its wake ; even now , the security system prefers to act selectively , when necessary , to avoid being set on fire , but the Jinin militants may not have a choice . <EOS>
Drawing Lessons from Future Events <EOS>
The IDF takes tremendous risks for its forces to avoid as much harm to innocent people as possible , sometimes at the cost of the lives of fighters . This is an indication of high morale , but it also has intelligence value : A terrorist caught alive - as happened yesterday in Jenin - is a source of information about terrorists , bombings , and other acts of terrorism ; it is information that cannot be obtained in any other way and thus makes it possible to thwart future attacks . <EOS>
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation , if anything , a definite bottom line could be reached on the matter . In any case , it seems that nothing will convince the convinced : the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without having to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestine 's terrorism - the original cause for which the IDF operates relentlessly in Jenin . <EOS>

As always , the nature of such stories perishes . World opinion is preoccupied with her and moves on , especially as Ukraine continues to rage in several intense wars . It is therefore a pity that Israel insisted on giving the interpretation of Abu Akhla 's death additional unnecessary moments of exposure , with the police handling of her funeral unsuccessfully . <EOS>
Responsibility obliges us to act to calm the situation . <EOS>
The Minister of Internal Security and the Commissioner of Police who ordered the investigation of the incident did well . They seem to have lacked sufficient preparation and clear guidelines , but it is troubling that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short period of time , and in two different districts . <EOS>
They are found on the left and right , and use their immunity not to challenge the state , but to harm it . HHK Ofer Kasef is the latest example of this ; if no measures are taken against him - including prosecution for assaulting a police officer - the State will implicitly encourage the next public elected official to further escalate his actions . <EOS>
Such moves , which in the eyes of a defending democracy , are essential in this explosive period , with behind them factors that seek to exploit the situation for political purposes . Anyone with a clear head is expected to rise above all of these and act to calm down ; otherwise , Israel may quickly slide into an escalation against enemies from the outside , and worse still - against opponents from within . <EOS>
Elon Musk : " If I die under mysterious circumstances , it was nice to meet you " . <EOS>
The owner of Tesla and Twitter makes a stinging early morning tweet after Dmitry Rogozin , chairman of the Russian space agency , accused Musk of providing satellite Internet service to " Ukrainian Nazis " . <EOS>
Musk , who recently acquired the social networking site Twitter , surprised his followers with a post in which he translated the words of Rogozin , the chairman of the Russian space agency , which wrote that during an interrogation by a Ukrainian commander , " it turned out that the Internet stations of Musk 's satellite company Starlink , are supplied by helicopters to the fighters of Nazi-Ukrainian battalion ' Azov ' and Ukrainians landing in Mariupol .

Thus , the Russian official said that " Elon Musk is involved in the supply of military communications equipment to the Rakhine forces in Ukraine " . Rogozin concluded his remarks with a direct threat against the tycoon : " For this , Elon , they will settle accounts with you like a grown man , no matter how stupid you play it " . <EOS>
Musk did not remain obliged and in a typical tweet responded directly to Rogozin via his Twitter account , writing that " if I die under mysterious circumstances , it would be nice to meet you " , referring to his remarks while criticizing between the lines the way the Russian government " handles " criticism against them and especially against President Vladimir Putin . <EOS>
Despite Musk 's humorous tone , his mother , May Musk , worriedly wrote , " This isn 't funny ! " <EOS>
The price of gasoline is rising and Israelis will have to pay in July more than eight shekels a litre . <EOS>
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price per liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8.08 shekels . <EOS>
A decade 's high : The price of gasoline will soar by 36 cents a liter - to more than 8 shekels per liter as of July 1 . The new price for a litre of 95-octane petrol , at 8.08 , will require those seeking full service to pay an additional 21 pence a litre . At the same time , a half-shekel-per-liter reduction in the solar tax is scheduled for the end of 2022 , the tax authority said . <EOS>
The price increase is due to the continuing rise in oil prices , against the backdrop of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the appreciation in the dollar . If it were not for the half-shekel discount subsidized by the government since April , the price of fuel would have passed the all-time high of 8.25 shekels per liter . <EOS>
The discount expires at the end of July , and the Tax and Customs Administration is promoting the publication of a decree extending the reduction in the tax on gasoline , which is half a shekel per liter , until August 9 . <EOS>
We 've reached a point where I can 't remember five consecutive months of a surplus in state revenues . We started a few months ago with the issue of reducing the tax on solar . For a week now we have been working on extending by four months the blue , gasoline and solar tax - instead of half a shekel a kilo . It 's good for industry and the citizen . If we go down , it will affect inflation , remove production and ease the cost of living . <EOS>
Today , more than half of the cost of fuel comes from taxes levied by the government ( blue tax and VAT ) - a high tax rate compared with most developed countries . The price of gasoline has a dramatic effect on the economy 's living costs - affecting household as well as business expenses , public transportation and airline fares , transport costs , and more . <EOS>

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are engaged . <EOS>
Almost two decades after their love story ended in a breakup , Lopez and Affleck return to each other 's arms . • Lopez separated from baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021 . <EOS>
One of his : Almost two decades after their first romance ended in a breakup and a year after a reconciled comeback , Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing the romantic loop and getting engaged . <EOS>
The joyful news was shared last night ( Friday ) by Lopez with her fans on her official website onthejlo.com <EOS>
The announcement of the engagement comes after the week-long documentary Lopez turns up with a giant diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger . A representative for her confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged . <EOS>
Remember , the last time Affleck , 49 , pulled out a ring and offered it to Lopez , 52 , to be his forever was in 2002 , and it was an eye-catching ring with a giant six-carat pink diamond , estimated at $ 2.5 million . <EOS>
Despite the grandiose gesture of love , the two separated in 2004 , accusing the media of over-obsession and relentless harvesting of their lives . <EOS>
Since then Affleck has been married to actress Jennifer Garner , the mother of his three children , while Lopez , as is known , was married three times before , including to singer Mark Anthony , who together became parents of twins . <EOS>
Lopez 's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez , from whom she separated in April 2021 after a four-year relationship , including two years of engagement . <EOS>
Shocking and Unfathomable : A heated debate at the Health Committee on poisoning at a Daffna home <EOS>
The indicators of the first patient who died were normal ten minutes before her death • Committee Chairman H.H. Silman : " If people there cared that the kitchen would be like home - it wouldn 't look like this " <EOS>
Ten minutes before the 40-year-old first inmate of Beth Dafna hostel in Holon died of food poisoning , her medical records were taken and she was in good condition , according to a health committee hearing Tuesday . <EOS>
We have night nurses who check in during the night and we have a nurse who does rounds . There have been several reports of diarrhea and the tenant actually the last time she had measurements was 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal . She was under observation like the rest of the dialysis diallists . <EOS>
The incident in which three residents died , six were hospitalized and a total of a quarter of the residents ( 33 out of 131 ) suffered diarrhea for eating contaminated surfer meat . <EOS>
Dr. Neema Nuss , head of epidemiology for the Department of Health , noted that " we cannot definitively determine what the three residents died of . Only blood tests were taken " . It was also discussed that even from the residents admitted to the hospital , a stool sample could no longer be taken because it was not theirs and therefore the cause of death and disease could not be determined with certainty . <EOS>
An engineer from the Ministry of Health also noted that " the Health Ministry checks the health status of kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Welfare Ministry or to apply for a license renewal " . <EOS>
The chairman of the Health Committee , H.K. Edith Silman , said during the discussion : " If people there cared that the kitchen would be like a home - it would not look like this . The living quarters in the welfare homes need more . They are health-sensitive and require extra supervision and care . It is shocking and incomprehensible what is happening there . <EOS>
Yigal Nahdoumi , the CEO of the Eckstein House who runs the hostel and even ran it himself , said , " Hundreds and thousands of people all over the system are rising up with only one goal : to do good to people . The people who died are people I personally cared for . I put one apartment to sleep on my hands . It 's a shocking event for us " . <EOS>
Oren Hellman , founder of the Equal Opportunity Project to Incorporate People with Intellectual Disabilities , regrets that the names of those who died have not been published : " We don 't even know their names . They 're worth less ? <EOS>

Her Friday : <EOS>
My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones : The Friday dinner that Asti Zakheym dreams about , and how does she deal with the fact that her husband keeps the Sabbath ? <EOS>
Tell me about your readiness to sit <EOS>
Preparations begin as early as Thursday night , when I come home from a show or workshop and cook until three o 'clock in the morning everything that takes a long time to cook , such as noodles , onions , and moisturizers . On Fridays , during the early part of the day , I take time for myself , meeting with friends for coffee , a play or a movie , or attending rehearsals . <EOS>
Can you share some more cooking ? <EOS>
I like shortcuts . For example , instead of peeling 10 onions , cutting them and crying , I buy a bag of frozen onion and fry it . On my Saturday table you can find meat dishes , vegetarian tofu , potatoes and oven-baked cabbage . <EOS>
Your husband 's a religious man and you 're from a secular home . <EOS>
Living with a Sabbathkeeper is an endless compromise . ' You must love your neighbor as yourself ' has become a reality . He cannot go out on family trips , so I often find myself packing the children and joining friends ' families . <EOS>
Who would you like to host on Saturday ? <EOS>
He is not the one who is in the heavens , nor the one who is in the heavens , nor the one who is in the heavens , nor the one who is in the heavens , nor the one who is in the heavens , nor the one who is in the heavens , nor the one who is in the heavens . <EOS>

Do you have any special childhood memories from weekends ? <EOS>
We were a warm , close-knit family . On Friday afternoons , Mother would make a bunch of sausages , bring back hummus and peppers from the market , and bake them into a grilled salad . Then we would drive to Aunt Hannah 's house with Elijah , or as she would say ' Elijah ' , and she 'd make linchpins . <EOS>
Criminal investigation must be opened against her : city inspector of Haifa on serious charges of torturing Klish Rotham <EOS>
The city inspector 's report raises concerns about alleged criminal conduct by Dr. Anata Klish Rotherham against former municipal officials and political opponents : employee stalking and inflated payment to the accounting firm for conducting investigations • " The difficult findings of the report require the opening of a criminal investigation • Haifa Municipality has not commented <EOS>
Tracking of municipal employees and political opponents and an inflated fee to the Auditor 's Office for conducting investigations , " at the expense of the public purse " . A report from the Haifa Municipal Inspectorate , Ofer Tal , published yesterday ( Tuesday ) , raises fears of alleged criminal offences by Mayor Dr. Klitsch Rotham against former municipal officials , municipal workers , and opposition politicians . <EOS>
According to the suspect , Klish met with the accountant 's office in Rab & Co. and requested an investigative review . The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to a former municipal councillor , and a code name given for a council member , Sofi Nakash , to check whether the tenders between the city and between a company owned by the family of Naksh , are as close as possible . <EOS>
This has resulted in no one in the municipality being aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant , and what the scope of work required in each of them is . Furthermore , the hourly reports that the auditor submitted were in many cases not approved as required . A situation has arisen where the volume of issues in which the county auditor was involved has grown disproportionately , with a lot of interference within the municipal infrastructure management and without any supervision from the city . <EOS>
In the report 's conclusion , the review recommended that unpaid payments to the accountant be suspended until material is received detailing his work on each of the issues examined . <EOS>
In addition , bills filed with the city of Haifa were under codes such as " threshold guards " , information store , fish shop , investigative review of the mayor and an acquired investigation review report . Shortly thereafter , the assistant city attorney , lawyer Ymit Klein , noted that the Mayor herself signed the payment approval on her behalf . " I was not summoned by any investigation report and I don 't know what it is about " , she wrote . <EOS>
Former Mayor Jackie Wakim responded : " These despicable acts of defaming elected officials at the expense of the public purse and taxpayer are a criminal offense " . <EOS>
Sophie lashed out at the city councilwoman in her response : " The inspector 's report and the committee recommendations speak for themselves " . <EOS>
Attorney for Haifa City Council member Sharif Gulen 's response : " The hard evidence and findings from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the operation of the Counsellor for Investigative Review to conduct investigations , which raises doubts about whether some of them are permitted by law as they were carried out and in particular the inquiries concerning the opposition council member , the mayor and former senior officials " . <EOS>
Lior Detz of the Threshold Guards Association : " All the red lines seem to have been crossed that a public authority sends private investigators to gather information against lawyers representing an organization that exposes corruption and at a time when the organization is conducting public proceedings against the Haifa Municipality " . <EOS>
Haifa Municipality has not responded . <EOS>

This is how police are trained to eliminate terrorists from the civilian population . <EOS>
The Jerusalem Police Department is training a new " Assaf " facility that simulates shooting in a crowded crowd in response to the series of attacks that have occurred in recent months • The MGB 's Anti-Terrorism Guide Surrounds Jerusalem : " Developing , Responding Relevantly to Threats and Simulating Reality on the Ground " • A Look at the Assaf Facility <EOS>
Preparing for the next attack : A series of terrorist attacks carried out this spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs , killing 19 people and wounding about 70 civilians , led the Border Guard to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to attack terrorists within the civilian population and fire on the move . <EOS>
Unveiling of Israel Today : A look at the Asaf facility . <EOS>
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security necessary to manage a normal life of a civilian population . The severe wave of attacks that has occurred this year , with attacks in Bar Sheba , Hadra , Beni Barak , Ariel , Elad , and especially the one that took place at the beginning of April on Dizinghof Suan Street in the heart of Tel Aviv , by a terrorist embedded in a crowd , have led the police to think creatively to develop a tool through which fighters can be trained to storm terrorists within a civil population . [ 1 ] <EOS>
The thinking was led by the Police and Border Guard Training Branch . These competed in the various police districts under the title " Leading Learning Commanders " , in which each district was required to develop means to help improve the policing and combat skills of fighters , police officers and commanders . <EOS>
As part of the competition , and in response to the need to train MGB fighters to fight in movement shooting training and such descriptions , Asaf Ben David , a counter-terrorism instructor for the Jerusalem Encircling MGS , developed the " Asaf Device " , which consists of a dynamic target , connected to a telescopic mount on which is a lever that can be leveraged by the instruction . Their job is to guide the bearer to die , he can practice the fighter standing in front of him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and spaces . <EOS>
It should be noted that in recent years , Border Patrol fighters have faced many attacks in which the perpetrator fires and poses a threat while moving through areas saturated with innocent civilians . <EOS>
For example , the telescopic rod , which is upgraded and integrated into the device , is taken from the maintenance and cleaning area . The device can be used to simulate shooting in motion within a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object , handling a traffic stop , selecting a path of progress performing a static shot including a practice of preventing harm to uninvolved targets . <EOS>
R.S.V. Asaf Ben David , after whom the facility is named , says : " The faciity we have developed , is a breakthrough in the education and training of soldiers and police . The development , gives a relevant response to the threats and simulates the reality on the ground . <EOS>

For borrowers whose monthly repayments have risen significantly and who find it difficult to pay them back , he recommends considering recycling a mortgage and spreading it over a longer period . This is to reduce payments despite the increase in interest , since it is always better to keep paying back than to be in bankruptcy . <EOS>
For new mortgage borrowers - he highly recommends getting to know the different routes and tailoring the loan to their financial capabilities , so that even in the future when interest rates fall , they will be able to recycle mortgages with a minimum of early termination fees . <EOS>
As for buyers of residential properties - a group recommends making advance payments to the buyer and taking out a mortgage now . It should be borne in mind that the " construction deposit rate " raises the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract is signed . <EOS>

By 2050 , the world will have lost 80 % of the water available for agriculture . <EOS>
A new global study predicts a significant decline over the next 25 years • The Solution : Proper Water Management <EOS>
A disturbing new study recently published in the journal Earth 's Future predicts that by 2050 , the amount of water available for agriculture will shrink by about 80 percent if the rate of global water use and population growth continues at current usage trends . <EOS>
In the study , which involved scientists from all the world 's science agencies , the scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater , rivers , and freshwater resources on the planet and compared it to human needs for agriculture . <EOS>
The study 's grim findings show that the rate of water use is now doubling over the past 10 years , while global warming is reducing rainfall in agricultural areas around the world . <EOS>
One of the key findings from the study calls on farmers worldwide to adapt their farming practices to climate and seasonal changes , and to switch to growing methods that focus on water infiltration into the soil to prevent the process of water depletion leading to widespread waste of rainwater . <EOS>

Model of healing : Three top doctors talk about their mentors <EOS>
Prof. Gallia Raheb misses the wit and wisdom of Professor Marvin Shapira LL , especially during the pandemic • Dr. Salome Kudish does not forget , even in spite of his role , the encouragement from Professor Saul Soknik LL • and Dr Efert Baron-Herb thanks Dr Tommy Schinfeld for the lesson in sympathy with patients • Three key people in hospitals write about who inspired them and encouraged them to be better , as caregivers and as human beings <EOS>
Three senior doctors , three teachers of life and profession : On the occasion of the Israeli Doctor 's Day , Israel Today invited Prof. Galya Raheb , Dr. Shalomi Kudish and Dr Efrat Baron-Herb to recall the characters who accompanied them on their journey - and helped them become who they are today . <EOS>
Professor Gallia Rahab , head of the Infectious Diseases Unit in Shiba . <EOS>
The meeting that opened my eyes - and changed my life <EOS>
If I hadn 't met Professor Marvin Shapira Jr . , who was the director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Hadassah Hospital , I probably would have remained an internal medicine specialist . <EOS>
I met him in the halls of Hadassah , back then in 1980s . I never thought for a moment that I would leave the hospital , because I loved treating the patient himself ; but Prof. Shafira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also expressed in neurology , also in hospitals , and in fact in every field . <EOS>
Throughout , I loved his investigative approach , an approach that went to the root of the problem . The discussions with him were analytical and logical . He was a doctor with all his soul , who loved patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything deeply . <EOS>
At first , when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and the one who had the greatest influence on me , I would choose my father , Dr. Joseph Rakofer , Jr . , a Holocaust survivor who served as a medic in a guerrilla unit . He was an amazing doctor , who influenced me to go into medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Schapira . <EOS>
He was married to a physiotherapist who worked in engineering and the father of two daughters . He died about a year ago , and when I visited his family at the age of seven , I was crying . <EOS>
Brought to light : Measure will cast a light <EOS>
Dr. Shalomi Kudesh , director of the Soroka Hospital about Professor Saul Soknik Jr . <EOS>
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors . <EOS>
I first met Professor Saul Soknik LL when I was a fourth-year medical student , and I came to the Internal Medicine round in the D-Department , which he directed . I later returned to that department again in my sixth year and did my final medical school work under his guidance , writing a computer simulation on a patient with polyarthritis ( inflammation of multiple joints ) . <EOS>
Then , a wave of " no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no <EOS>
Saul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life for 20 years , and was the most significant man in shaping my image as a doctor ; not only professionally , but also - and most importantly - personally and humanly . During my internship I hesitated between family medicine and internal medicine , consulting with him on my choice of specialty . <EOS>
To this day , I recognize in myself , as a physician and as an administrator , traits that come from Seoul . When I finished my internship and was considering whether to go abroad for a residency , Saul pushed me , and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to proceed . <EOS>
On my return , when I received an offer to join the hospital administration , Shaul was again the one who supported and helped . Later on , we managed complex periods together in the department of internal medicine . Shawl was able to perfectly integrate the teacher , director , fellow and team member , without his various roles interfering with each other . I aspire to succeed as he did in this special combination . <EOS>

The man who taught me medicine , especially listening , <EOS>
Dr. Tommy Schinfeld , founder and former director of the Intensive Care Unit at Schneider Children 's Medical Center , taught me how to be an intensive care physician , but more than that -- he told me to think . <EOS>
The obvious thing I 've learned from him is to take care of the most complicated , the sickest of children -- children , some of whom were healthy just a moment ago , and are now between life and death -- and it 's obvious to have very difficult conversations , maybe the hardest ones , with families who never imagined that they would be in these complex situations in the ICU with their children . <EOS>
But I 've learned even more meaningful and profound things from him , and looking back , as a doctor who 's an executive and a director who is a physician , I now see the connection between the worlds ; the education that I got from Dr. Schinfeld connects them . <EOS>
Dr. Schinfeld taught me to listen attentively to a lot of things : listen to the children , listen at the monitor , listening to nurses , to caregivers young and old alike , and to parents . <EOS>
All of this needs to be done not only to communicate more accurately and effectively but also to gather at all times a wealth of information that can prevent further deterioration . Preventive processes in pediatric care are ubiquitous , and of course so are in intensive care . <EOS>
My understanding today as an executive is that these insights are also true when looking at a whole system , and the deeper and more rigorous the understanding that occurs , that includes all the actors in the conversation , the more accurate the decision-making process will be , tailored to the situation and , most importantly , inked early to prevent future damage , immediate or far-reaching . <EOS>
That 's why Dr. Tommy Schinfeld is so much more to me than an inspirational figure . He is a man who has taught me a lot about medicine , but most of all , how to think fast and precise , listen -- and then apply . <EOS>

Study finds : Zoom meetings are harmful to creativity <EOS>
Around 2,100 engineers and academics from around the world were asked to develop solutions to a problem some in video conferences , others in face-to-face meetings • The result : A virtual meeting hurts creativity and thinking outside the box • Lead researcher at Columbia University : " Visual focus on a screen harms the process of creating ideas " • Comfort Forte : No harm to productivity or critical thinking <EOS>
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the impact of video conferences on the creativity of participants , compared to face-to-face meetings . <EOS>
The question of the study -- led by Melanie Brooks , an assistant professor at Columbia University -- was whether computer-based remote meetings preserve the creativity that occurs in office brainstorming meetings , or whether the level of creative and free-thinking decreases as a result of distance . <EOS>
People in a face-to-face meeting move around a room , use objects , and help them think creatively , says Brooks . " In a computer meeting , by contrast , the focus on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain . <EOS>
Space is shrinking . <EOS>
To test the results of the experiment and see if they repeated themselves , they were tested twice -- once at Columbia University and once in real life -- on engineers who knew each other from early acquaintances . <EOS>
At the university , the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts : one asked the subjects to meet in person and develop solutions to a problem , and the other asked them to do so via a computer . Simultaneously , 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe , Middle East and South Asia were asked to divide in a similar way and solve a newly presented problem . In both cases , a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking was found among those who met virtually via video . <EOS>
Jay Olson , a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher on ways to measure creativity , was not involved in the study but wasn 't surprised by the results . <EOS>

When people are in the same room , they look around and see the space , where there are objects and situations that can evoke new associations in them . However , research shows that computer interactions change our attention so that we are more focused on the inside and the screen , and this reduces innovation and idea generation through looking at the environment and thinking outside . <EOS>
There is no harm in critical thinking . <EOS>
However , before managers rush employees back to the office , the researchers note that " computer work did not affect productivity itself or people 's critical thinking about innovative proposals , when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas . That is , it only affected creativity and not other forms of computer work " . <EOS>
Professor Alan Langer , a professor of psychology at Harvard University , also disputes the findings . She says : " There is a difference between mere creativity , such as new uses for the parasite , and workplace solutions . <EOS>

Information about many students from Bar-Ilan University leaked online <EOS>
Hackers who attacked Bar-Ilan University 's database a few weeks ago threatened to release the students ' information unless they received a ransom . <EOS>
Students at Bar-Ilan University are under attack by hackers when their personal information is published online by an attacker known as Darkrypt who posted a ransom demand from the university a few weeks ago and threatened that if he is not paid an unspecified amount of money , he will publish the information under his control . <EOS>
Estimates of the amount of money that the attacker demanded are that it started in the thousands of dollars and as the clock ticked , it went up and before the information was released it was already several million dollars . <EOS>
Facebook groups of university students and faculty are full of angry messages and chaos is celebrated there , as students are unable to log into their personal information systems and can 't perform routine student tasks . <EOS>

No specific instructions were given to those whose information was compromised and it said that the university had taken a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of university administrators . <EOS>
Serious breach of privacy on Route 6 <EOS>
Route 6 customers ? Your personal information , including your full name , addresses , payment amounts , and details of trips you have booked , may have been exposed • The Privacy Authority alleges that a transit company violated the Privacy Act and its regulations <EOS>
Following a report that Via Aretz , a highway operator in Israel , had been made aware of a security incident that had occurred at the company , the Privacy Protection Authority initiated an enforcement procedure . As part of the incident , security vulnerabilities were discovered on its payments website , which allowed for the exposure of large amounts of information from the member 's customers ' accounts that were exposed to the public . <EOS>
Among other things , customers ' payment accounts were exposed over a relatively short period of time and these accounts included personal information , including first and last name , payment amounts , vehicle location , travel dates , and what hours . Furthermore , because a transit company did not legally record access to its systems , it is not possible to know exactly how long unauthorized parties could access the company 's systems . <EOS>
In the breach letter , which the Privacy Authority forwarded to the company , the Authority emphasized that most companies and large organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy , and that as threats and risks evolve , an organization has an obligation to carefully consider the updated risks and act accordingly by updating the security measures accepted under the circumstances , depending on the nature and quality of the database . <EOS>

Companies and organisations are also required to use an automated record-keeping mechanism and must provide training to employees , in accordance with the provisions of privacy ( information security ) regulations . <EOS>
Based on the inspection findings , the Authority determined that the company had violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Act and its regulations and required the Company to take a number of corrective actions . <EOS>

Fatah has reached second place in the ranking of doing business of the Ministry of Economy • After them : Streets , Ashkelon and first for note • Minister Berbibai : " The coronavirus has highlighted the importance of local government in business development " <EOS>
Ashdod is the most business-friendly city for small and medium-sized businesses for the third year in a row , according to the Doing Business in Local Authorities Index of the Ministry of Economy and Industry 's Small and Medium Business Agency , which ranks local authorities . <EOS>
In the second place is the city of Open Hope , and in the third place are streets . After them are located in order : Ashkelon , First Zion , Tel Aviv-Joppa , Haifa , Ramat-gen , Sholon , Beer-sheba , Jerusalem , Beth-sim , Nethaniah and the sons of Barak . <EOS>
The Agency is publishing this Local Authority Index for the fifth time and its purpose is to serve as a working tool for local authority , as it allows each authority to compare its performance to other authorities in a variety of parameters , and to analyze their performance in the areas in which it operates . <EOS>
The index is based on several parameters that are examined in each municipality , which evaluate the level of " friendliness " of the authority to businesses in its territory . It divides the municipalities into three groups of size by population , since a local authority of up to 50,000 inhabitants is not the same as one of more than 150,000 . <EOS>
T.A. jumped this year . <EOS>
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different scores for each local authority : business satisfaction , accessibility to auctions , access to information , and wealth . <EOS>
A downgrade in the ranking does not mean that the Authority 's business service has deteriorated , and in many cases it is due to the fact that other authorities ' business services have improved and have been ranked higher , while the lower-ranked Authority has not done as much to improve its services to businesses . Among the top performers are Apteka , which has moved up from sixth to second place , as well as Streets , that has risen from 12th place to third place . <EOS>
Business as a Growth Engine <EOS>
The ranking shows that the Galilee landscape tops the list of local governments with between 50,000 and 150,000 inhabitants . It is followed by Kiryat Mushkin , Beniamin Headquarters , Makhbet-e-Roh , Kafr Saba , Rennah , Nakhariya , Karmiel , Efula , and Hud al-Sharon . In 28th and last place is Tabria . <EOS>
The measure is designed to encourage local authorities to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses , from the time they open their businesses to the length of their time with the authorities , says Minister of Economy and Industry Orna Berbibai . <EOS>
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us , however , the local authority has a direct impact on the businesses in it . The Corona has highlighted the importance of local government and we have seen that authorities that have acted and supported the promotion of the small business and found creative solutions for them , have become the first government interface to them " <EOS>
Ren Koiti , director of the Small and Medium-sized Business Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry , adds : " Local authorities play a central and essential role in the ability of businesses in their area to thrive and flourish . In the last two years , as we deal with the coronavirus crisis , authorities have put more emphasis on helping businesses to survive and survive in general " . <EOS>
State inspector 's report : the actual budget for most years of operation of the pharmaceutical basket committee less than the recommended budget <EOS>
According to the report by Methanieu Angelmann , for more than 20 years of Basket activity the Ministry of Health has not supervised the activities of the Committee • The report also states that the minutes of meetings are published significantly late , if at all • Also , the critic recommends to increase the transparency of subcommittee activity and update the procedures for Basket work • Another deficiency found concerns the fact that since the committee began its activities , Health Ministry did not ask the hospital boards to report on the volume of use and utilization of drugs in Basket which would have allowed to analyze and control the budget that can be used <EOS>
The Drug Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and our health . Each year , the committee decides on new drugs to be given to the public free of charge through health insurance funds but a new state inspector 's report released today ( Tuesday ) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without audit reports and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council overseeing and examining its activities . <EOS>
Israel Today columnist Ren Resnick adds that the State Auditor 's investigation was conducted in the wake of the ongoing exposures in " Israel Today " of drug cart manufacturers . <EOS>
According to the report by Methanjo Angelmann , he recommends " to make corrections and improvements in the basket expansion process , which will lead to a more qualitative extraction of the healthcare basket budget to which the public is entitled " . Throughout the years that the mechanism has been in existence , eight billion shekels of drugs were added into the state budget in 2021-1998 , with the surplus moving annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million . <EOS>
In 2019 , 2020 and 2021 , requests were made to add about 800 new medicines and technologies to the health services basket , at a total annual cost of more than NIS two billion . In practice , the budget allocated for the expansion of the basket was less than the scope of applications . <EOS>
The critic notes that the amount of the annual surcharge needs to be reviewed and adjusted in order to allow for certainty and long-term planning . Angelman also noted that " the transparency model in basketball work is lacking " . For example , the basketball committee 's working procedure stipulates that minutes of meetings , which are closed to the public , be published within 60 days , but in practice minutes are published 160-109 days late , with sometimes final meeting minutes not published at all . <EOS>
The delay in the publication of protocols impairs the transparency of decisions ; as a result , it may impair the ability of proposers hospital organizations and pharmaceutical companies to reapply as soon as possible and appropriately , after they have learned from the rejection of their proposals , analyzed the reasons for the failure of the previous round , improved and corrected their proposal , and re-evaluated their readiness to accept it in a subsequent round , the reviewer noted in his report . <EOS>
Of the thousands of submissions , only one financial comment was submitted . <EOS>
Another criticism of Angelman concerns a preliminary procedure for evaluating technologies submitted to the drug basket . The reviewer found that half ( 46 % ) of the submitted technologies did not pass this stage , but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection . <EOS>
Another deficiency concerns the activity of the Subcommittee on the Medicine Basket , which is closed to the media and the public , and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed . The reviewer recommends that a public representative be included or that the discussions be made public without confidential commercial details . <EOS>
For example , requests to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket for the 2021-2019 discussions of the Basket Committee were made . The report found that the applications were not accompanied by economic estimates , including an estimate of how much could have been saved by reducing the harm of diseases caused by obesity or by being able to avoid gastric bypass surgery . <EOS>
It also arises that the decisions of the drug basket committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of Ministry of Health . For example , in 2019 , the ministry of health defined cancer prevention and preparation medicine for the treatment of chronic diseases as targets , but the decision on the expansion of basket did not emphasize the need to achieve these goals . <EOS>
The reviewer also warns that since 2011 the medicine basket also includes non-hospital insurance services , including various rehabilitation and mobility devices and vaccines , provided by the Ministry of Health ( " Third Supplement " ) . This is when the legal framework for this step is regulated only in retrospect . In the last six years , NIS 74 million from the supplement to the drug basket has been used for these services . <EOS>
Angelmann recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket working procedures and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services . About one-third of the new drugs entering the medicine basket are designated as " no-cost drugs " , the use of which does not cost patients an additional amount because they replace existing treatment . The reviewer suggests examining the possibility of these drugs being prescribed in a different and shortened route so that prescriptions can be updated several times a year rather than just once per year . <EOS>
There 's no control over the use of very expensive drugs . <EOS>
The criticism also shows that since the work of the Basket Committee began 20 years ago , the Ministry of Health has not asked hospitals to report nor supervised the extent of use and utilization of drugs in the basket , information that could have enabled the ministry to analyze and audit the budget given to the funds . Over the years only two reports relating to 2009-2006 have been published . <EOS>
Delays in testing may lead to difficulties in data collection and analysis , irrelevance of conclusions after such a long time , subcommittee bias and decisions based on incomplete findings , the report said . <EOS>
Also , the Ministry does not monitor and supervise the use of particularly expensive medicines and has not produced samples . These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62 % of the addition to the basket ( NIS 1.7 billion in 2021-2016 ) . Regarding this , a reviewer wrote : " It is recommended that the Health Ministry carry out individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the scope of their use against estimates . <EOS>

When the age of sadness moves from punch to talk of holiness <EOS>
It 's weird to see the comedian , the ex of Comedy Store , host a show called " Saturday Reception " on Channel 14 , where he tastes slices and gives the main stage to men . <EOS>
If we were playing a game of association , we would all have similar answers to the question , " What does the concept of 'readiness to sit down ' remind you of ? " You say : a sponge and cleaning , pots on the gas and smells in the staircase , Iron Elan or my father as a TV presenter , but the strangest thing would be if someone suddenly said " Age of Sober " . <EOS>
And in fact , " Saturday Reception " , his new show on Channel 14 at noon on Fridays , is disconnected from the hour it 's on . For half of it - Sassover is standing . He speaks quickly , holding a microphone even while tasting dishes , trying to divide the dose between punches and conversations about holiness . <EOS>
In his defense , it will be said that the budget deficit is felt , and this is probably the maximum that can be produced in these conditions . However , what is also felt in the premiere program , broadcast the next day from the headquarters in Benjamin , is a clear gender division .

Research : Most household tenants are unaware that tax refunds are available <EOS>
Many renters receive money from the state , which can reach tens of thousands of dollars . • Have you changed jobs ? <EOS>
Most renters are unaware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds , which can add up to large sums . <EOS>
The State Comptroller noted in a report about two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds of NIS 3.6 billion , which means you should also check whether you are eligible for tax returns . Many employees can receive a large amount , since four out of five employees qualify for a tax return . In practice , however , several tens of thousands of employees file a year . <EOS>
Tax : On conducted an in-depth survey of 4,000 of its customers on their tax returns during 2020 . The company has over 30,000 customers , so the sample reflects their distribution by population groups and by gender , age and geography . <EOS>
The data shows that during 2020 , due to the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis and the expenses of hundreds of thousands of employees for the company , there were a number of significant changes and at the center of them was a 15 % increase in the average return to a parent 's home that stood at 4,300 shekels a year . The reason is that the starting fees are lower than wages and therefore a gap is created between what the employee paid as tax and what he actually needs . <EOS>
What can I get a tax refund on ? <EOS>
For 81 % of people who changed jobs during the year , an average tax refund of NIS 2,943 was generated . <EOS>
The data shows that 74 % of women who gave birth and stayed on maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were eligible for a refund of an average of NIS 3,538 for the same year . <EOS>
100 % of the people who donated and paid taxes got their money back . <EOS>
63 % of divorced couples did not renew a maintenance claim , so the tax refund for each year in which such a claim has not been renewed is NIS 2,616 . <EOS>
Due to unemployment - Expenditure to the state : 93 % of those who became ill or unworked and earned more than 12,000 shekels received a tax refund of 4,021 shekel for the same year . <EOS>
Other reasons for tax refunds include : refund of life insurance payments , life assurance on a mortgage , return of a gain , refund for losses on securities , failure to register birth credit points for a male , and distribution of the tax return by geographic location . <EOS>
- 94 % of people who took out personal life insurance or a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund . <EOS>
100 % of the migrants received a tax refund for the year of transition because the residency permit is only issued after 12 months from the date of becoming a resident and thus in fact the first year is full tax paid . <EOS>
79 % of the clients holding securities were eligible for tax refunds for the years in question . However , it is important that the holder of a security check every year as the losses are not rolled over from year to year but only by filing a report . <EOS>

Three years after the operation in Gaza , the IDF revealed the name of Colonel M. Bennett : " Now the people know the face of an Israeli hero " . <EOS>
Mohammad Khair al-Din from the village of Khorphish is a lieutenant colonel who was killed in the operation in Khan Yunis • Chief of the General Staff : " Publicity is due to him , his family and his children " • The possibility of publishing the photo of Colonel Emanuel Morno on a patrol of MTC will be examined later <EOS>
About three and a half years after the operation that involved Khan Yunis , the IDF allows today to announce that the one killed in action , Colonel M , is Colonel Mahmoud Khair al-Din Zall from the village of Khorphish in the north . <EOS>
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication : " It has been three and a half years since Lieutenant-Colonel Mahmoud Hira al-Din Jalal was killed in action in a covert operation in Khan Younis , and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the country . <EOS>
Mahmoud Zal was a paratrooper and later rose through the ranks to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF Special Operations Command . <EOS>
He also said : " I honored him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him , the name and face of the Israeli hero , Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Hira al-Din , publicly " . <EOS>
The environment brought its eyes to him . <EOS>
Since the operation , the IDF has forbidden the publication of his name for security reasons , and today , after a discussion by the head of the Intelligence Branch , General Aaron Khalifa , with representatives of military censorship and with his family 's consent , it has been decided to publish the name and picture . <EOS>
Mahmoud Khair al-Din , a hero of Israel , was born on 28 December 1977 in the village of Khorphish in Upper Galilee , the eldest son of his parents Ahmad and Nasira , and has seven siblings . He is a Druze Witness . <EOS>
Throughout his life , Khir al-Din was a social leader , and the environment looked up to him . He attended school in the village of Khurphish until the tenth grade , then went to the military boarding school at the Royal School in Haifa . In October 1997 he joined the paratroopers ' patrol and in 2000 he graduated from the officer 's school . <EOS>
In 2002 he met his wife , Nahid , and in 2004 they married . Their first son was born in 2009 , a year in which he and his fellow members founded an association that works to promote the status of the Druze in Israel . In 2010 he joined the " Akhari " association and began mentoring a group in the village of Horphish , after ensuring that its association would start operating in Druse villages to encourage youth to enlist . <EOS>
The head of the IDF , Colonel Aaron Haliwa , explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name : " It 's been a while since we became involved in the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair al-Din , the hero of Israel . We have finished work and we have come to the conclusion that there is no security impediment to publishing its name and image . It also deserves him , his family and his children " , he said . <EOS>
Exceptional Educator and Leader <EOS>
He deserves the place that belongs to him " . He added : " I did not know him personally , but he was an outstanding educator , mentor , and leader - not only on the operational side but also in my values " . <EOS>
Operation Khan Yunis took place on 11 November 2018 . The operation was the culmination of long months of meticulous preparation in which the intelligence community took part . <EOS>
The purpose of the operation has not been allowed to be published , and the IDF stressed that this was an operation that the intelligence did not exclude . However , in the Arab media , communication equipment was shown in retrospect that , according to the Palestinians , was left behind by the forces . <EOS>
According to publications , on the day of the incident , the force travelled in two vehicles . The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint set up by Hamas personnel , and something in their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives . Activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers . <EOS>
The interrogation in the field lasted for about 45 minutes , during which time it became more and more aggressive . When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation , Colonel Khir al-Din managed to distract the Hamas people , and within a fraction of a second the commander of the Force , Sergeant A , was able to open fire . <EOS>
Ten months after the difficult incident , the commander-in-chief , Lt. Col. Abib Kochbi , decided to accept the recommendation of the Salwa Committee and award the Chief of Army Staff to three fighters in the incident deep inside the Strip - among them also Colonel Khir a-Din Zell . <EOS>
In the Army 's announcement , it was stated that S.A.L. M. received the Sal 'sh for " his activity in the operation under his command , in enemy territory , with determination , coolness and courage , to protect his friends . Later he acted out of initiative and desire for contact , took a leading role in taking control of the enemy and worked diligently to promote the takeover " . <EOS>
Give them a chance : the Israelis of the MTA saved the Sporopolis <EOS>
After losing the Derby and the eighth consecutive in Europe , a defeat in the Classico against Jerusalem - would have apparently ended the long romance between the T.A. Maccabi and a Greek coach • So to whom does Yanis have to send flowers tonight ? To his Israeli team , which was in charge of 42 critical points at Arena • Also : Why the Yellow Club should change its ' Americanization Strategy ' , and take a live example from the model of Ariel Beit-El-Hachmi in Eilat <EOS>
It 's hard to remain cynical about the look of tearful eyes and warm , strong hugs that Yannis Sporopoulos gave his players at the end of tonights game in the Arena , and especially in light of the close encounter and exchange of secrets with John Debreau , through whom he saved the Greek coach his job and perhaps the entire season . <EOS>
Because after losing at home in Derby and eighth in a row in Europe , to also lose at the Jerusalem Classic and be away from it for three table wins ? That would have ended the Israeli-Greek romance already tonight . <EOS>
First , the T.A. came in with a radical change in his offensive and passing habits . The ball moved aggressively , with lots of movement and practice , and Scotty Wilbkin , in a demonstrative way , left the focusing job to Evans , as he drove very little , mostly over blocks and went for shots . <EOS>
However , towards the end , naturally with less oxygen in the brain , the team returned to their old habits , and the attacks went back to the drums and shots and on the most critical offense , with 2 and 40 seconds to go , Scotty drilled himself into the corner and threw a one-legged floater that almost lost the game . Wisdom is to continue to play drill and dedication movement precisely at the moment of the clash , which must go into Teddy and team DNA . <EOS>
2 The important lesson will be made by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis . Those who have become water pumps and towel wavers in European games . Tonight they scored for the coach who stopped believing in them more than half the team 's points ( 42 out of 83 ) and were the ones who kept the game alive at the end . Four of the top five scorers in the Maccabi were Israeli . <EOS>
In the first half , it was mostly Ozz Blazer , who had been screaming for a month that he had to play more . He 's punchy , moral , a fighter under the basket ( 7 rebounds ) , 2 meters of defensive determination and clever play . Isn 't that enough ? <EOS>
But the important lesson should be the club 's , about its Americanization strategy . Fact : Senior Israelis no longer want to come to the Maccabees . <EOS>
And it 's happening because there are gradually fewer places left for Israelis in Maccabi , because of the clubs informed and radical choice to be based on Americans . MacCABI will soon reach the water line , where there will be no Israeles who want to play in it , and then it will look for Jewish children to get citizenship and pressure the management / union to increase the number of foreigners even more . <EOS>

It is better to concentrate on more interesting achievements such as energy supply , acquisition of Israeli technology , transportation from Ashdod and Haifa ports via Jordan to Saudi Qatar and the UAE , tourism enabling Israeli infrastructure companies to work in Saudi . <EOS>
It 's more important that they let the Air Force squadrons be stationed in the Persian Gulf to hit Iran and that we arrange for the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Oman , Egypt and Morocco to drop weapons on Iran non-stop for a month until all of its military infrastructure is completely destroyed . And another air force squadron to deploy in northern Saudi Arabia and hit Iranian forces in Syria and eastern Iraq from a less dense area . <EOS>
After we 're done with Iran , Saudi Arabia can push Oman , Kuwait , Djibouti and the Comoros to make a peace deal with Israel and get a majority of the Arab League countries to join the peace . <EOS>
After the regime change in Iran , after the World Cup , the oil and gas market stabilizes , and replacing Erdogan can also help Saudi Arabia overthrow the rule in Qatar and finally eliminate the subversion of this country , its support for other Muslims and Hamas . <EOS>
When all these mutual interests are over , we can talk about a few more Aleel flights if she even survives by then . <EOS>
Al Al needs to shut down . They sell tickets for flights that don 't exist . The worst thing is that there 's no way to get a " no customer service " representative . Anyone who buys a ticket at AL Al and wants to change or cancel it should forget about it , a sure loss . See you warned . <EOS>
Air Canada is better . <EOS>
In any case , they prefer to fly abroad . <EOS>

A 40 euro suitcase is much cheaper than a Wi-Fi . You can carry a backpack weighing 8 kg . Why are you mistaken ? <EOS>
One big whisper . <EOS>
Just for example . I just got back . <EOS>
The permissible weight is 30 kilos . <EOS>
And a seven-pound troll . <EOS>
And every extra pound is $ 30 . <EOS>
Go check it out . <EOS>
All the companies steal the customer , they advertise very cheap prices , but in the end , it 's a case the size of a school bag . <EOS>
A trolley already costs money and a suitcase costs very , very dear . <EOS>
It 's a good thing the airlines don 't ask us to come on a flight with underwear and body armor so there 'll be no weight on the plane . <EOS>
Al Al , the price is not cheaper , but 50 % off booking up to 6 hours before the flight . <EOS>
The Israelis aren 't at all surprised , they were , and still are , successful combinatorics . <EOS>
A country that eats its inhabitants and has good food ... It 's also a shame for our country to let foreign airlines lure Israelis ... There is no government and everyone here does what they want <EOS>
So what did you learn today that it 's not enough that you paid for an expensive ticket . Prepare a surprise for all of us . Pay extra for the plane wheels on the windows on bags that don 't come on food on drinks and they 'll probably add on toilets . <EOS>
The IDF has finally been ordered to deal with the terrorists . <EOS>
I hope we don 't return to the days of helplessness of Ahmed Bibi and the ultra-Orthodox . <EOS>
I wonder what 's true from one newspaper to another ! <EOS>
I can 't understand why the force of a rifle can only kill one terrorist . <EOS>
Stop posting pictures of terrorists . <EOS>
Unless you yourself are looking to promote terrorism <EOS>
I wish every terrorist who dares to throw a bomb at our soldiers would be shot to death . <EOS>
Wishing our forces next time to take down more than one <EOS>
Practice accurate shooting - every bullet less than a terrorist <EOS>
We need to invest more in fighters , and work on precision . <EOS>
They couldn 't have hit just one terrorist . <EOS>

A foreign minister , a clown who comes sick with Corona to a cabinet meeting . <EOS>
And the most clownish prime minister we 've ever had in this country is out of control and losing his mind like the last of the hooligans . <EOS>
Just a government with no leadership and no direction . The entire nation of Israel has lost faith in it . <EOS>
Go home and be one hour early ! ! ! <EOS>
In my opinion , <EOS>
Maybe it 's coming from a bad place but a place of loss of control . <EOS>

And in the last four general elections , the Election Commission was prepared to attack ? <EOS>
Why don 't you detail , for example ... how many attempts to infiltrate and disrupt the Election Commission have been made and managed in the last three years . <EOS>
Don 't we deserve some data , facts and proportion ? <EOS>
It 's good to have a good spirit for everyone . <EOS>
Depends on the increase in internal reverence ... <EOS>
And the necessary disciplinary reinforcement of center and guard <EOS>
And that 's the management part . <EOS>
That 's a good line . <EOS>
As for the Israelis , he 's absolutely right ! <EOS>
And the comment about Xu - we saw last season that he 's a good player who can also lead a team . So in Euroleague he can 't be a leader , but the decline in his ability also in the league indicates he has lost his confidence ( which is not surprising after the treatment he received after two bad EuroLeague games , as if foreigners did not play such games ) and the use of it may also be incorrect , and it is the result of the coach being fixed and lazy . <EOS>
The blazer didn 't go off with all due respect ... <EOS>
He 's not playing well , but Sorkin and Blazer Dodi and Cohen today . <EOS>
Iddo Ashad is a lousy fan of a club that gave him 500 checkers so he writes crap . <EOS>
It 's not Federman in the picture . <EOS>
Blazer , Sorkin and Guck Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor who in Europe play 20 minutes and can 't score a basket , who needs foreigners at the level of nothing and nothing , so much the better that the Israelis play . <EOS>
In short , he said nothing . <EOS>
It would have been better if the doctor had avoided saying , " We don 't know if it 's X or Y yet " -- because it doesn ' t contribute anything to the reader ' s knowledge , but it leaves them with both X and Y stuck in their minds -- and after two weeks , that too will be forgotten - and what is left is just simpler " X Y and Z W things " related to corona . <EOS>
What is clear is that Pfizer 's propaganda writers are working overtime from research to research funded by ... <EOS>
Don 't be fooled . <EOS>
Quote : " The causes of commonly reported symptoms , such as weakness and headaches , are * not yet known . * Regarding myocarditis , opinions are divided " . Notice , they themselves admit that they have no idea how the vaccine affects the body , so how dare they even push it on people ? <EOS>
Quote : " There are all sorts of theories on the subject , but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine " . <EOS>
That statement is based on false and contradictory research . <EOS>
The study looked at vaccinated people versus patients and came to the conclusion that the risk from the virus was four times greater than from a shot . Even if we ignore the fact that they took elderly and severely ill people who were intentionally inoculated and included them in the statistics , that conclusion still doesn 't take into account that there 's less than a 10 percent chance that anyone is going to be infected with a vaccine , which is a likelihood that includes all infections since the coronavirus started , and people are already getting a third shot and on their way to a fourth . <EOS>
We 're the most vaccinated country in the world and the number one in deaths from coronavirus . <EOS>

How do you know what 's gonna happen in 30 years ? <EOS>
Someone here missed an important detail . <EOS>
Scientists don 't care about warming or who rains . <EOS>
They 're only interested in population growth . <EOS>
They 're working on more and more vaccines and asshole methods to wipe out the world 's population , so they tell us bogus stories about warming and all the crap they make up . <EOS>
There 's no problem dropping water in unlimited quantities <EOS>
They said that 50 years ago . <EOS>
The solution is to limit births , especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi 's baboons , the rest of the anti-state leftists , and all the religions that believe in gods -- in fools , ignorant , lazy , blind , or in short , cattle -- <EOS>
There is an urgent need to reduce world population . <EOS>
Living things ( including mammals ) consume oxygen and emit carbon dioxide . <EOS>
The solution : Smurfs , kill yourselves ! <EOS>
It 's green . Good for the world . It will be better for you , and certainly the earth and all of us . <EOS>
Who are the scientists and how did they do the research ? I don 't believe any research that talks about global warming because it doesn ' t exist . It ' s a tendency to control us to take away our freedom and freedom . <EOS>
Just burning money on academic sketch research . <EOS>
As usual , another excerpt from the psychopathic smurf country . <EOS>
Human knowledge is expanding and with it new and improved technologies . <EOS>
For centuries , the world 's population has been growing steadily at an exponential rate , and the situation is only getting better . <EOS>
The Chinese , for example , have embarked on a huge project of warfare at the mouth of the Gobi , with amazing success . <EOS>
The Saudis are doing the same thing and succeeding too ( with Israeli knowledge , by the way ) . <EOS>
It 's the smurfs ' stupid " climate crisis " that is making the Sahara greener , but hey , it doesn 't fit the Smurf agenda , so you won ' t read about it in the papers ... <EOS>
Left-handed people don 't worry , because their pee goes straight to their head , so they 're not dehydrated . <EOS>
Does proper water management mean a reduction of at least 70 % of the world 's population ? <EOS>
It 's amazing that COVID is coming , and it is surprising that most of the population is being injected with experimental material whose 5- to 25-year implications on the subjects are completely unknown . <EOS>
I 'm really wondering the whole story ! ! ! <EOS>
He 's full of shit . <EOS>
Stories of a thousand and one nights , all the fears and of course the nonsense of the left trying to rule the world through media control , five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two . They said that even in the land it did not rain anymore and the drought is constant and here it rains . <EOS>
It 's obvious you 're promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030 . <EOS>
That 's disgusting shit . <EOS>
Almost everyone nowadays has an " old " tablet or smartphone lying in a junk closet , just because a slightly newer and more sophisticated model has come out , any device can be a Spotify player with a WhatsApp connection , old devices could be traffic cameras , a remote control to operate appliances in the home and many other uses , they don 't have to be victims of consumer culture and they do not need to always be at the forefront of technology , with another really useless gadget . <EOS>
Gathering data without analysis . <EOS>
It was more interesting to hear how many people received allowances at the Israel Post , how much the real estate of the branches ( located in the requested city centers ) was worth , and what the workers ' wages were ( minimum ) . <EOS>
Israel 's post office must not be privatized . <EOS>
The question is , how many packages have arrived and how much have been distributed ? <EOS>
You order packages , and they disappear into the ICU ... <EOS>
There ought to be a five-pack tax . Don 't start up some bullshit shill and load up the mail . <EOS>
It 's mostly indicative of the high cost of living in the country . <EOS>
Thanks to the Shit King for making it better to buy everything from China . <EOS>
We 're a household and we try to stay away from the post office and hope they don 't get any mail and our hatred of the mail has led us to give up everything that pertains to the possibility of mail . <EOS>
Fire all the postal workers , and start re-establishing the post office by a private company . <EOS>
Well , bubons - did you hear that at this point Musk is stopping the purchase ? ... Are you going to blame the left again ? You 're great ! Keep it up ! <EOS>
Donald Trump is an idiot and he 's inciting violence . <EOS>
On the other hand , it should have been suspended , not blocked . <EOS>
As we learn more about the ingenious move made here by Elon Musk , the damaging results over the next two months will speak for themselves . <EOS>
I left Twitter because of the incitement and the poison that babies spread there . <EOS>
Musk is progressive in a different way , in the way of trying to shut Trump up instead of getting him off the grid . <EOS>
Hiding a tweet from a president just because he 's a patriotic Republican is not free speech . <EOS>
Musk bought Twitter for Musk -- everything else is secondary . <EOS>
Elon Musk should fly the scrubs to Mars and leave them there . <EOS>
In a simple statement , Musk destroyed the Trump enterprise . <EOS>
That 's right ! <EOS>
He 's a right-wing American patriot conservative and technologically progressive <EOS>
No rioting at the Capitol . <EOS>
The rioters work for the FBI . <EOS>
Trump beat Biden . The election was stolen . <EOS>
My fellow Americans , the storm is upon us ... <EOS>
Can 't wait for the return of Donland and Benjamin . <EOS>
Musk - he 's just a miracle to stop and repress the fascist leftist dictatorship that controls all social media , the fascistic left press , academia - that blocks all non-failing opinion , and above all rightists ! ! This is how the Fascist Left elected Biden as the most failed president ever to the presidency - despite the colossal corruption of him and his family , his senility and incompetence as president , racism and more ! ! So the left is controlled in the US and here by a small minority in our judiciary and media ! ! <EOS>
Maybe he 'll also buy Israel Today ? <EOS>
With the Turks , it 's the other way around , and anyone who understands will understand . He compares a side that attacks without reason and murders civilians to an Israeli schoolgirl who defends herself from killers who shoot rockets at old people and children . <EOS>

What is Palestine ? These are Philistines who have been extinct in the world since biblical times . The Arabs are not philistines . <EOS>
I wonder what the Palestinians did under Turkish occupation . <EOS>
There are 27 Arab countries , let the Palestinians choose where to fly ... because Israel is the homeland of the Jews and the people of Israel ! <EOS>
And there never was a state of Palestine ... and even if there was , it wasn 't in the territory of Israel and Judea and Samaria ! <EOS>
It 's sad that Israelis are going to Turkey , the country of hypocrisy ! ! ! <EOS>
I didn 't know him , a brilliant , amazing man . <EOS>
Ahhh ... what about our dear Nick Cave , who dared to pretend to tell the truth in the face of incessant hanging and threads of lies on top of the lies of our Arab cousins and all the other Zionists . <EOS>
What are we going to say , and here at home , in our family -- a half-government holding on to exactly the same lie as that salty Turk . What do we say ? What will we do ? Yair Lapid thinks that the Holocaust is like black slavery in Africa , yair Gulen thinks Israeli Jews , Israeli citizens living in the territories of Judea and Samaria and Gaza -- they 're subhuman , Moshe Reza is convinced that we need to protect the " Palestinian narrative " from the destruction of Palestinian archaeology ... and Omar is bravely collecting weapons from Jews in Lydda and Ramallah , so that he can defend himself against the coming attacks . <EOS>
What I say and what I 'll say . <EOS>
All respect and admiration to Nick Cave , all contempt and shame to those who voted for the parties in the current government . <EOS>
Once again the Turks ... will rejoice in the name of Ahmed and his Turkish-Nazi leader Erdogan . <EOS>
Jews , Israelis , stop visiting this filthy country . <EOS>
Ahmed 's right , of course . <EOS>
Nick Cave - part of the unconscious Ashkenazi hierarchy <EOS>
Show me a guy named Nick Calhoun who listens to his songs . <EOS>
I 'm in the clouds that Ashmaday 's selling furniture is back to being the driver of the crazy woman he married and cheated on . <EOS>

Keep buying products from Turkey . I 've been importing this country for years . <EOS>
We have nothing to look for there even free hotels . <EOS>
One of the problems with Palestinian propaganda is the perversion of justice and human cruelty to all that is true . <EOS>
The comparison between the struggle of a small people in a bubbling state to survive in the jungle of violent and murderous civilizations that have devastated the entire Middle East ( and only we , thank God , survive ) , and the invasion of the world 's largest state army into the largest country in Europe , without provocation , just to establish power and international standing ... who here has decayed morality ? <EOS>
I 'm no longer talking about the " Palestinian suffering " and " horrors " they 're going through here - all this rhetorical nonsense that steals attention from those who are really suffering in the world ... Ahmed is the representative of absolute evil pretending to be just the opposite . <EOS>
Intelligent , critical people who know how to analyze reality correctly are the leaders this generation needs especially in the West . <EOS>
A man came out , only a pity that he doesn 't understand politics any more , it was a response to the anti-Semitic Arabs ( because their hatred has nothing to do with Palestinians ) that Hamas is the nice one who ruins the lives of the enlightened Palestinian people who continue to choose terrorism , choose and cry their problem ! ! ! <EOS>

Shame on your paper - the Turkish " fan " is a funded demagogue who also gets published in your newspaper <EOS>
We need to rob the Turks . What about the Kurds they 're drowning in ? <EOS>
There has never been a " Palestinian " in the history of the world so they are the invaders of Israel . They were all Jordanian citizens who also moved to live in Israel over the last 200 years but most moved after the state came from neighboring Arab countries because of work and economic constraints . <EOS>
Turquoise Satan is supporting Adolf Erdoğan <EOS>
We love you Nick ! ! ! Come again ! ! ! <EOS>
Palestinians - Muslim migrant workers who expected Israel to look for work with Jews who had begun to develop the country . <EOS>
There are Palestinians all over Europe and the demand to make it Palestine will come in a few years . <EOS>
There 's a place to cancel a show in Turkey specifically , both because of the Armenian massacre , and the Kurdish slaughter , as well as the occupation of part of Cyprus , so , a Turkish with butter on his head , not going to Nick Cave . <EOS>
Turkey , whose country occupies northern Cyprus and Idlib province in Syria . <EOS>
The fictitious nation does suffer from a brutal regime -- in Gaza , Hamas , and in the West Bank , Abu Mazen . <EOS>
It 's interesting that he doesn 't mention Assad , Iran , the Houthis , Hamas and Hezbollah who are ruining the lives of the people . <EOS>

It 's always an Arab worker who steals the database and sends it to some hacker friend in Indonesia to share in the blackmail profits . <EOS>

Maybe they don 't send invoices and after a while they just send a ticket , and tell the customer we sent a bill and blame the mail for it not coming . And then they tell you to subscribe so you don ' t forget to pay because we 'll have credit card information , so they do a subscription and then someone hacks into their lousy system and steals details . Something is totally fucked up there and nobody checks them . <EOS>
Do we get a refund ? <EOS>
As a software engineer , who also deals with information security and IT security tools , the level of service providers ' naughtiness and embarrassment is simply frightening , hitting a new low every two days or so . Whenever an organization loses its pants and panties in public , all the " experts " immediately take advantage of it to make a serious , worried face , and announce that they need to double their security budget , instead of fixing the repair that needs to be done -- and usually throw out monstrous amounts of code and software and the worst tools -- including complicated and unnecessary cloud services , as well as laying themselves off , because they didn 't cause any of the damage . <EOS>
I think it 's only going to come out of the pocket . If customers who 've been hurt , take a six-count lawsuit and get -- even 30 bucks for every subscriber whose details have been stolen ( yes , I also mean Shirebit customers , and every other service that has been hacked ) then after one or two bankruptcies -- company executives will start taking seriously their fucked-up , broken information systems . <EOS>

Between the rotten traitor Benet and Fidel , the crumbling post-Zionists are now adding to their Palestinian government , and along with Hamas activists they are also selling the representatives of Palestine 's terrorists from the Joint List ! That is , Israel is already entirely run by Palestinians working to destroy it ! ! and accordingly , Fide announced this week that from now on he and the treacherous Bet will use the joint list to save their government and that together with the Shura Council and R.E.M. of the Muslim Brotherhood they will continue to eliminate the state ! ! the sale of The Negev and now the selling of Harar to the Syrian and Iraqi terrorist councils , by law and our Arab aid budgets would be up to 53 billion in addition to what we received in the past and five billion more in total income from terrorism , which , according to him , would <EOS>

It 's time to stop pushing the word fearful into every article or headline or opening of every issue on television . <EOS>
Who 's scared ? <EOS>
A good heart fails not only when he speaks , but also when it acts or rather does not act . <EOS>
He doesn 't have the understanding that in a situation as delicate as a halo , he needs to be on it in real time . Or he has the realization that it will only interfere more and so he shies away from responsibility and then goes back to blaming the one who did it , to take the blame off him . He also turns out stupid , like Ehud Barak with all the nerve he had , when acting in the sunlight turned out foolish . <EOS>
But the goal is to clean up Janin after years of purple dirt neglecting the situation there . <EOS>
I pray that the government of Persia and your enemies will leave you . <EOS>
Get up there . <EOS>
The refreshing crook is unable and unwilling to cope with the reality . The Arab and Islamist who is being shamed is a despicable and shameful man who has done terrible damage in his few months of rule here to Zionism , to settlements and to the resistance of the IDF . <EOS>
Why is a big wall-style operation better than a Pincet operation ? A big operation has a better chance of getting into trouble . We need to start by closing the breaches in the fence , and taking care of the seawall , which will also put our troops at much less risk . <EOS>
In the very near future it will be possible to see the achievements made by Ba 'ath Party in the talks she held with the replacement Prime Minister Yair Lapid within the framework of the conditions she set for her staying in coalition ! ! <EOS>
It 's true that the world is busy in Ukraine but when the story there is over Europe and the United States will impose sanctions on us too . <EOS>
Yoav Lemor the fool you propose to belittle and behave like a daughter of the answer . Fool already said did we ? A herd of donkeys do not understand the language of speech and only force and shots are beauty beauty will understand . <EOS>
Who will give the order and approve ? ! <EOS>
Council of Assyria ? ? ? ! ! <EOS>
Bennet , you 're dead already ! <EOS>
The reason for the Palestinian riots is the sloppy treatment of the police , they know that any police violence will lead to committees of inquiry and investigation and that is why they are celebrating . <EOS>
I 've proposed action in Jenin in the form of a retaining wall . The esteemed Shura Council will meet next week and email its decision . <EOS>
I understand Jerusalem Day has been canceled . <EOS>
Baby-sitters praise smugglers both for not caring about national security and for putting the law on the line and therefore supporting a serial killer . <EOS>
Only the lycanthrope can whine . <EOS>
Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Minah Min <EOS>
Because they want praise for cheap labor for the economy because not everyone here is high-tech or a manager , so prices don 't go up any more than they are right now . <EOS>
If there are no praise money in the Palestinian Authority will trickle down because they are very corrupt and will only go hand in hand which will cause the strengthening of Hamas and instability . <EOS>
And the anointed in Israel don 't have the guts to train the rabble and collect taxes and give licenses <EOS>
Can the security guy explain what the policy was a year ago ? <EOS>
Is it possible that the security guy is even a ... <EOS>
In the very near future it will be possible to see the achievements made by Ba 'ath Party in the talks she held with the replacement Prime Minister Yair Lapid within the framework of the conditions she set for her staying in coalition ! ! <EOS>
They have autonomy and we have a state . They don 't have enemies . Why bring them in in the first place ? <EOS>
Leave them there rotting with themselves . <EOS>
Why don 't you present endless border areas without fences and fencing in a horizontal position ? Lips waste and waste Israel 's citizens . Why do you allow the enemy to invade to make a living in Israel and occasionally murder civilians in cold blood ? <EOS>
Bardugo now announces that Bennett , the traitor , fired Kalfon at Abbas 's request , after Kalphon went up to the Temple Mount ! ! <EOS>
Anyone who enters the territory of Israel without a license should have a dissuasive attitude not to repeat himself . I don 't think you need examples . <EOS>
The treatment of terrorism requires the closure of all breaches in the separation fence , and a complete halt to the praise phenomenon . Entry should only be allowed with permits through controlled crossings . In this way , for example , it is possible to limit the age of entrants ( let 's say over 30 ) because most of the last terrorists were young people in their 20s . <EOS>
The Jewish state is engaged in defense . It builds fences . Iron dome walls . <EOS>
If we don 't go on the offensive , we 'll just be left with an atomic arsenal . Christians , start worrying . <EOS>
I have set goals : to collect all of them and disperse in the countries of the evening ! ! ! There are many many <EOS>
The target is not Bibi . <EOS>
Therefore , it makes no sense for them to enter through breaches in the fence , says a senior security official , " whoever wants to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the controlled crossings , and there have been cases like this before " . <EOS>
In other words , a people of killers . <EOS>
Divorce them and they 'll come back <EOS>
You 've solved the problem . <EOS>
Quite simply , for every Arab and supporter , set a goal . <EOS>
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and hurt in Israel , while still gaining exposure and support from his new fans . <EOS>
Just when it starts to get messy , there 's a waiver . <EOS>
This isn 't the peak of the epidemic . <EOS>
Simon , it 's not for you . <EOS>
The number of confirmed cases is going up . <EOS>
Stop screening for all this nonsense . Stay home if you 're not feeling well . <EOS>
That 's it . <EOS>
A government of madmen . <EOS>
The government and Bennet are mostly bankrupt , out of control and mostly stupid . <EOS>
And confused the public . <EOS>
Only more harm than good . <EOS>
It suggests you open a new corner : " Daily cumulative deaths at the beginning of the fifth wave . Face and pictures behind the default " . <EOS>
You don 't understand the Secretary of the Treasury for not paying pizza to the tourist workers from them no more infection they do not care about the people 8500 died so far something speaks about it bury us especially the elderly <EOS>
We have become Russia / North Korea . If we do not talk about it - it does not exist ! ! The main thing is that the citizens will put money into the state coffers to grow the ministers the horn and the ass ! It turns out that Doberman and Abbas are the Prime Minister ! ! <EOS>
Very well , the omicron suspension was relevant for the first week , now -- there 's no reason to isolate half a nation , and there is no point in trying to stop the Omikron -- which is more present here than Israel . <EOS>
When someone comes from an orange country , they 're statistically less dangerous than someone who 's already here . <EOS>
This is the first time I 've seen any reasonable steps by the Israeli government in the fight against Corona . <EOS>
Like someone actually sat down and counted the numbers , and not like Bibi - did what he thought would look better in the paper ( and failed in all the sections ) . <EOS>
They said in all the episodes every year whoever wins the madurama will get 250,000 and suddenly in the last episode they changed it to the one who wins in less time than the others . <EOS>
It 's a shame that junk shows like Big Brother where the winner gets a million shekels for just gossiping and doing nothing and Ninja where she has a lot more ratings than big brother and the contestant trains all year for her so the prize is $ 250,000 and only to whoever wins . <EOS>
Yogi gets hurt and breaks his finger and still finishes the meduriama , heartbroken that he doesn 't get 250 grand for all the ratings he brought them . <EOS>
You are the champion of the world . <EOS>
He got another Jeep . You made him such a promo . My name can win . <EOS>
Three Forresters . And another 250 grand . What a box of ... cannon ! <EOS>
Watch Queen Yugav and you 'll see why everyone likes to hate this unnecessary spread . <EOS>
I was glad he didn 't deserve it . Nathan did a great job , and I 'm glad that Yugev did not win . He was too arrogant for my taste . <EOS>
It 's such a programmed and pathetic show , it really reminds me of Buzz in the ' 90s with the WWF . <EOS>
The foolish Israeli believes everything he 's shown on the screen . <EOS>
Is Jordan Sorby going on for season 5 of Ninja Israel ? <EOS>
Forget to mention the fact that Shival who has been a vegan for several years ! ! ! Probably because there is a sponsorship program for some yogurt that real athletes don 't even come close to ! <EOS>
A Jubilee so worthy of this title . <EOS>
He really came to this program for the sport and nothing else , and it shows in a significant way . <EOS>
Fitness , poor performance , modesty , values , ambition , after-the-fact , professionalism and punctuality . <EOS>
This show wouldn 't be the same without him . <EOS>
But he 's not a ninja to be a ninja you have to specialize in martial arts <EOS>
Can someone explain what this ridiculous medal ceremony with Jordan Gerbi was about ? <EOS>
What an asshole about a yogi ... the guy climbed the mountain in less than 30 seconds with a broken finger ! ! Crazy ! ! Even though I love Jubilee and he deserves to win a giant I 'm really upset for a Yogi who can 't be crowned 2 ninjas . Like what 's the problem ? Why is the format so fucked up ? <EOS>
He 's a full-on ninja ! <EOS>
Send him to the world competition . <EOS>

Queen is the main hero of yesterday . But he 's a heavy gunner . Already on his first year of becoming a ninja . If he hadn 't messed around with the ring there is a situation . <EOS>
How unfortunate that the Israeli production turned this into a dubious reality like survival when it gave women a special tip after they failed the usual tip and tried to keep it a secret . <EOS>
Who 's to say we didn 't give Semmelweis and his friends a few tries to cross the trajectory ? <EOS>
Or that the whole climbing part ended up being edited and took them a lot longer to complete ? <EOS>
There is no credibility . <EOS>
Good for you ! <EOS>
He beat the Moroccan Queen Yugav . <EOS>
All due respect to the humble Smirnoff and the sweet Lizzie . <EOS>
Regarding Queen Yogib , at the beginning of the season I wanted him to fall , <EOS>
Only because of his arrogance inherited from Casablanca and Marrakesh . <EOS>
It 's disgusting Moroccan . <EOS>
I didn 't understand why you had to publish half-naked pictures of him and another notice ? <EOS>
Sub-level <EOS>
You piece of shit ! <EOS>
You ruined my surprise ! <EOS>
There should be a law that says you can 't find out what happened at the end of a TV show or a reality show . <EOS>
She 's tired of it ! <EOS>
Now that they 've canceled this show , I 'm tired of watching it , and especially sick of biting the pillows and the collar . <EOS>
He deserves it after four seasons . <EOS>
All right , all right . <EOS>
A true professional , an amazing man . <EOS>
Good for you . <EOS>
Just need to change the guides . <EOS>
Jubilee full of a child amazing in every way humble poor and knew what he wanted <EOS>
You 're a source of pride . You are a talented athlete . Humble . <EOS>
The champion . <EOS>
Superman , Batman , and Spider-Man competed against each other . <EOS>
A real champion ! ! ! ! <EOS>
Congratulations to Jubilee for winning . He came out a king . <EOS>
The fact that the champion has trained so hard and achieved an important goal is an example for many athletes who want to be like him . It 's amazing ! <EOS>
The elf ! <EOS>
I was so happy that he won the first season . There are not many humble and cultured people like him . That 's it , I 'm looking forward to the next seasons . <EOS>
Congratulations , and congrats to you . <EOS>
What fun that wearing glasses is the best ninja ever in the State of Israel . <EOS>
The Jubilee has long since become Israel 's ninja symbol . <EOS>
I hope he 's a role model for the younger generations . I take my hat off to you . <EOS>
Max , I 'm glad you won . You deserve it . <EOS>
Athlete on the ! ! ! <EOS>
A real king <EOS>
There 's no need to whine ! <EOS>
A real king , the best he deserves . <EOS>
A champion in all dimensions ! <EOS>
I just think you 've kind of forgotten that Fargan Lishi , he 's just a twelfth grader , a humble , nice kid that I feel we can 't count . <EOS>

He 's the winner of the present . But don 't worry . <EOS>
An age is over and here comes a new age . <EOS>
And good luck to all of them . <EOS>
Plus , I wish Kushner would come back . <EOS>
It 's so nice to see such excellent Israeli athletes . First of all the winner and with him the two vice presidents and a whole line of excellent gymnasts who have gone through very difficult obstacles . It warms the heart . This program is 10 ranks higher than junk programs like Big Brother , Survival , etc . <EOS>
Dancing with the Stars is also a nice , positive show . <EOS>
The champion of Amity . <EOS>
