zh-en	WLEnsemble	592	A: The U.S. Department of Labor released January 2023 data on nonfarm employment, adding 517,000 new jobs, well above the 189,000 expected by the market; the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, its lowest level in nearly 50 years; hourly wage growth was 4.4%, relative to the rest of the world, 0.3%, slightly slower.	259 275	274 299	major major
zh-en	WLEnsemble	593	Overall, there are a number of one-off and technical disruptions to this data, such as teachers returning from strikes, corrections to survey statistics, updates to the seasonal adjustment factor, which may be corrected in the future (reference: January 2022 increase in non-farmers from 5.04 million to 36.4 million), or nonfarm employment is not as strong as the data shows).	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	594	Structurally, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies remains, but at a low level; new jobs in highly exposed services such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare have recovered significantly, and data show that the labor gap in the services sector remains.	107	123	major
zh-en	WLEnsemble	595	Combined with similarly higher-than-expected service PMI, recoveries in job vacancies and labor shortages, and stronger consumer credit data, we assess a rapid recovery in the U.S. service industry after extreme weather and holidays.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	597	Currently, there are more than 5 million labor gaps in the U.S. labor market, and labor participation rates are slowly rising, especially among those aged 25-54 who are nearing pre-epidemic highs.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	602	Prior to the release of the data, the US equity and bond markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's rate hike path.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	603	With inflation data continuing to improve, while the Fed continues to shorten the pace of rate hikes while maintaining the fragile balance of the market's expectations, the markets are turning a blind eye to the biased rhetoric by the Federal Reserve, which not only expects to stop raising rates early, but also to expect two rate cuts at the end of this year.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	604	In the context of tight labour market supply and demand and the uncertain impact of austerity policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and that extreme market expectations of adjustment and trade congestion will cause some damage to the market.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	605	Nevertheless, the persistence of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with the year-on-year turnaround of M2 data and the gradual improvement of the leading indicators of various CPI scores, since October the US CFI data has moved to a rapidly declining phase, while the persistent growth of wages will only serve as a basis for future Inflation data.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	872	Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorder and exacerbate its consequences. Research in high-income countries has confirmed this, and in these studies, an individual's socioeconomic trajectory is not only related to their condition at a given point in time, but also to a drug-use risk.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	873	Drug use disorders also exacerbate socio-economic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious cycle of deprivation.

zh-en	WLEnsemble	880	However, alcohol seems to play a greater role than drugs in violent incidents.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	881	Although drug use can lead to crime, in some cases this link can be partially attributed to a number of intermediate factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment and peer influence.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	882	The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	883	Large-scale organized criminal activity, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out in non-violent situations if there is a stable criminal structure.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	884	In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depends not on the quantity of trafficking but on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of illegal markets, deaths or imprisonment of known criminals, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	972	This will turn off certain non-compatible ANSI Cc feature keywords in GNU C c, as well as features such as unix and vax that are shown to be acceptable and rarely used, and will disable them despite the fact that all standard libraries under a hosted environment are available, the main function returns an int value, typically for almost all programs except the kernel.

zh-en	WLEnsemble	986	-fexternal-templates generates smaller code for template declarations (only limited to C++), the method is to generate a copy for each template function only where they are defined.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	987	To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementatio' ((definition) or „Çô#Pragm interface' (statement) in all files that use the template.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	988	When a program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', the template instantiation is all of an external type. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	989	This can be done with typedef, which he cites for every instance needed.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	990	Correspondingly, if the default option ` -fno-exteznal-templates' is used when compiling, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	995	The value of this expression is the Void.-fthis- is-variable which allows the assignment of a value to this (only for c++).	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	996	The incorporation of user-customized free storage management mechanisms into C++ makes the value-assignable 'this' seem unfashionable.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	997	Therefore, by default, the assignment of this to the class member function is invalid.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	998	However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation work by using the `-fthis- is-variable' option.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1000	Each machine has its own default char type. It can be either unsigned char or signed char.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1001	Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on data symbolicity.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1002	However, many programs have been written using only the simple char, and this is either symbolic (or non-symbolic, depending on the target machine that is writing the program).	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1003	This option, and its counter-options, allows that program to work at the corresponding default value.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1004	The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly the same as one of them.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1005	If the modifier ` signed' or 'unsigned' is not explicitly stated, these options are used to define a bitfield or a non-symbol field.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1006	By default, bytes are symbolic because they inherit a basic integer type, such as int, which is symbolical, however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, the byte is always unsymbolic.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1007	-fwritable-strings stores string constants to writable data segments without special treatment.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1197	Following the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users started looking for cheaper synthetic substances and switched to injectable drugs.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1198	At the same time, governments are cutting drug-related budgets.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1199	Interventions such as prevention of drug use and associated risk behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard if governments respond to the current recession in the same way.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1200	In addition, the priority of international cooperation in interception may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to act.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1201	Some countries have large quantities of drugs being smuggled on commercial flights and are expected to be the countries most directly affected by drug trafficking.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1202	Some messengers carry synthetic drugs, such as methamphetamine, in their backpacks or hidden in private luggage, sometimes in large quantities. As air passenger transportation is restricted in almost all parts of the world, the supply of drugs using commercial air travel may be completely interrupted.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1203	Although international postal supply chains have also been disrupted, trafficking using the dark web and freight mail may increase.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1211	Population growth patterns partly explain why the market is expanding	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1214	Over the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1215	This partly reflects the differences in the overall population growth over this period, with developed countries accounting for 7% and developing countries for 28%, but also the rapid growth of the young population in developing nations.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1219	Drugs are more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas, both in developed and developing countries.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1220	Part of the reason for the overall increase in drug use is the massive migration of people from rural to urban areas, where more than half the world's population now lives, up from 34% in 1960.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1221	Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where the trend is more pronounced.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1222	Increased wealth is strongly associated with increased drug use, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the poorest people worldwide, and drug abuse is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing ones.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1227	These patterns seem to be less common in wealthier sections of society.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1228	The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to increase the risk to the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1229	For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have been linked to an increase in drug use, an epidemic that has put tens of millions of people out of work around the world.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1230	The coronavirus pandemic may result in more farmers growing or engaging in illegal crop cultivation, or due to reduced control capacity of the national authorities or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illicit activities under the economic crisis.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1231	The associated COVID-19 restrictions have led to a decrease in air and land traffic, which may have resulted in an increase in maritime trafficking, a lower risk of interception at sea, and a greater number of cases of smuggling than air or land.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1232	Recently, there have been reports of cocaine shipments being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1237	However, the associated dangers of opioids are largely ignored due to the small number of users.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1238	Of the estimated 167,000 drug-related deaths in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances and 50% of the 21 million years of life lost to disability or premature death believed to be due to drug use.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1239	Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1240	In West, Central and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Kumado; in North America, by fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economics, demographics, or general patterns of drug use, but are struggling to combat opioids fueled by readily available and low-cost substances.	71	81	major
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1241	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1242	In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States were related to fentanyl.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1243	Canada reported similar results, but with lower numbers.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1244	Fentanyl leads to overdose deaths in part due to the unpredictability of the drug on the illicit drug market.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1248	In 2018, however, the global capture fell to 32 tonnes after India passed a new law regulating curcumin.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1249	Both crises were fueled by the simplicity of manufacturing and the low cost of production, as well as the lack of international regulation for Kumado and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.	143	153	major
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1250	Adding to both crises is the availability of these substances on both the drug and illicit markets, making them harder to detect and prevent abuse.	-1	-1	no-error
