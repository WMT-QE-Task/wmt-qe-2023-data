zh-en	WLEnsemble	592	A: The U.S. Department of Labor released January 2023 data on nonfarm employment, adding 517,000 new jobs, well above the 189,000 expected by the market; the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, its lowest level in nearly 50 years; hourly wage growth was 4.4%, relative to the rest of the world, 0.3%, slightly slower.	259 275	274 299	major major
zh-en	WLEnsemble	593	Overall, there are a number of one-off and technical disruptions to this data, such as teachers returning from strikes, corrections to survey statistics, updates to the seasonal adjustment factor, which may be corrected in the future (reference: January 2022 increase in non-farmers from 5.04 million to 36.4 million), or nonfarm employment is not as strong as the data shows).	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	594	Structurally, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies remains, but at a low level; new jobs in highly exposed services such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare have recovered significantly, and data show that the labor gap in the services sector remains.	107	123	major
zh-en	WLEnsemble	595	Combined with similarly higher-than-expected service PMI, recoveries in job vacancies and labor shortages, and stronger consumer credit data, we assess a rapid recovery in the U.S. service industry after extreme weather and holidays.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	597	Currently, there are more than 5 million labor gaps in the U.S. labor market, and labor participation rates are slowly rising, especially among those aged 25-54 who are nearing pre-epidemic highs.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	598	In addition, stronger consumer demand will further delay the impact of austerity on the job market due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit among U.S. residents.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	602	Prior to the release of the data, the US equity and bond markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's rate hike path.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	603	With inflation data continuing to improve, while the Fed continues to shorten the pace of rate hikes while maintaining the fragile balance of the market's expectations, the markets are turning a blind eye to the biased rhetoric by the Federal Reserve, which not only expects to stop raising rates early, but also to expect two rate cuts at the end of this year.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	604	In the context of tight labour market supply and demand and the uncertain impact of austerity policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and that extreme market expectations of adjustment and trade congestion will cause some damage to the market.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	605	Nevertheless, the persistence of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with the year-on-year turnaround of M2 data and the gradual improvement of the leading indicators of various CPI scores, since October the US CFI data has moved to a rapidly declining phase, while the persistent growth of wages will only serve as a basis for future Inflation data.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	880	However, alcohol seems to play a greater role than drugs in violent incidents.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	881	Although drug use can lead to crime, in some cases this link can be partially attributed to a number of intermediate factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment and peer influence.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	882	The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	883	Large-scale organized criminal activity, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out in non-violent situations if there is a stable criminal structure.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	884	In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depends not on the quantity of trafficking but on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of illegal markets, deaths or imprisonment of known criminals, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1005	If the modifier ` signed' or 'unsigned' is not explicitly stated, these options are used to define a bitfield or a non-symbol field.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1006	By default, bytes are symbolic because they inherit a basic integer type, such as int, which is symbolical, however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, the byte is always unsymbolic.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1198	At the same time, governments are cutting drug-related budgets.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1199	Interventions such as prevention of drug use and associated risk behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard if governments respond to the current recession in the same way.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1200	In addition, the priority of international cooperation in interception may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to act.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1201	Some countries have large quantities of drugs being smuggled on commercial flights and are expected to be the countries most directly affected by drug trafficking.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1202	Some messengers carry synthetic drugs, such as methamphetamine, in their backpacks or hidden in private luggage, sometimes in large quantities. As air passenger transportation is restricted in almost all parts of the world, the supply of drugs using commercial air travel may be completely interrupted.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1214	Over the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1215	This partly reflects the differences in the overall population growth over this period, with developed countries accounting for 7% and developing countries for 28%, but also the rapid growth of the young population in developing nations.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1219	Drugs are more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas, both in developed and developing countries.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1220	Part of the reason for the overall increase in drug use is the massive migration of people from rural to urban areas, where more than half the world's population now lives, up from 34% in 1960.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1221	Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where the trend is more pronounced.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1228	The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to increase the risk to the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1229	For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have been linked to an increase in drug use, an epidemic that has put tens of millions of people out of work around the world.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1230	The coronavirus pandemic may result in more farmers growing or engaging in illegal crop cultivation, or due to reduced control capacity of the national authorities or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illicit activities under the economic crisis.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1231	The associated COVID-19 restrictions have led to a decrease in air and land traffic, which may have resulted in an increase in maritime trafficking, a lower risk of interception at sea, and a greater number of cases of smuggling than air or land.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1232	Recently, there have been reports of cocaine shipments being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1237	However, the associated dangers of opioids are largely ignored due to the small number of users.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1238	Of the estimated 167,000 drug-related deaths in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances and 50% of the 21 million years of life lost to disability or premature death believed to be due to drug use.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1239	Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1240	In West, Central and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Kumado; in North America, by fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economics, demographics, or general patterns of drug use, but are struggling to combat opioids fueled by readily available and low-cost substances.	71	81	major
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1241	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1242	In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States were related to fentanyl.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1243	Canada reported similar results, but with lower numbers.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	WLEnsemble	1248	In 2018, however, the global capture fell to 32 tonnes after India passed a new law regulating curcumin.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1249	Both crises were fueled by the simplicity of manufacturing and the low cost of production, as well as the lack of international regulation for Kumado and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.	143	153	major
zh-en	WLEnsemble	1250	Adding to both crises is the availability of these substances on both the drug and illicit markets, making them harder to detect and prevent abuse.	-1	-1	no-error
