Generally, monitoring the condition of the newborn and correctly decoding the monitor monitoring fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of development of foetal distress, allowing the medical team to act quickly and rescue the infant before it is irreversibly injured.

Each year, the committee decides on new drugs to be given to the public free of charge through health insurance funds but a new state inspector's report released today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without audit reports and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council overseeing and examining its activities.	238 352	255 357	major major

Throughout the years that the mechanism has been in existence, eight billion shekels of drugs were added into the state budget in 2021-1998, with the surplus moving annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million.	27 377	45 386	major major
he-en	gpt-4-5-shots-xml-shots-per-language-no-ref-just-annotation	483	In 2019, 2020 and 2021, requests were made to add about 800 new medicines and technologies to the health services basket, at a total annual cost of more than NIS two billion.

he-en	gpt-4-5-shots-xml-shots-per-language-no-ref-just-annotation	484	The critic notes that the amount of the annual surcharge needs to be reviewed and adjusted in order to allow for certainty and long-term planning. Angelman also noted that "the transparency model in basketball work is lacking". For example, the basketball committee's working procedure stipulates that minutes of meetings, which are closed to the public, be published within 60 days, but in practice minutes are published 160-109 days late, with sometimes final meeting minutes not published at all.	147 173 245	155 225 267	major major major

he-en	gpt-4-5-shots-xml-shots-per-language-no-ref-just-annotation	490	It also arises that the decisions of the drug basket committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of Ministry of Health.

This is when the legal framework for this step is regulated only in retrospect. In the last six years, NIS 74 million from the supplement to the drug basket has been used for these services.	4 44 377	12 59 388	major major major
he-en	gpt-4-5-shots-xml-shots-per-language-no-ref-just-annotation	492	Angelmann recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket working procedures and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services. About one-third of the new drugs entering the medicine basket are designated as "no-cost drugs", the use of which does not cost patients an additional amount because they replace existing treatment. The reviewer suggests examining the possibility of these drugs being prescribed in a different and shortened route so that prescriptions can be updated several times a year rather than just once per year.	9 302	19 310	major major
