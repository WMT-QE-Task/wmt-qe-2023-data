zh-en	KUNMT	592	A: The U.S. Department of Labor released January 2023 data on nonfarm employment, adding 517,000 new jobs, well above the 189,000 expected by the market; the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, its lowest level in nearly 50 years; hourly wage growth was 4.4%, relative to the rest of the world, 0.3%, slightly slower.	232	251	major
zh-en	KUNMT	593	Overall, there are a number of one-off and technical disruptions to this data, such as teachers returning from strikes, corrections to survey statistics, updates to the seasonal adjustment factor, which may be corrected in the future (reference: January 2022 increase in non-farmers from 5.04 million to 36.4 million), or nonfarm employment is not as strong as the data shows).	187	208	major

zh-en	KUNMT	604	In the context of tight labour market supply and demand and the uncertain impact of austerity policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and that extreme market expectations of adjustment and trade congestion will cause some damage to the market.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	KUNMT	1230	The coronavirus pandemic may result in more farmers growing or engaging in illegal crop cultivation, or due to reduced control capacity of the national authorities or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illicit activities under the economic crisis.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	KUNMT	1231	The associated COVID-19 restrictions have led to a decrease in air and land traffic, which may have resulted in an increase in maritime trafficking, a lower risk of interception at sea, and a greater number of cases of smuggling than air or land.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	KUNMT	1241	In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	KUNMT	1249	Both crises were fueled by the simplicity of manufacturing and the low cost of production, as well as the lack of international regulation for Kumado and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.	-1	-1	no-error
