zh-en	KUNMT	592	A: The U.S. Department of Labor released January 2023 data on nonfarm employment, adding 517,000 new jobs, well above the 189,000 expected by the market; the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, its lowest level in nearly 50 years; hourly wage growth was 4.4%, relative to the rest of the world, 0.3%, slightly slower.	232	251	major
zh-en	KUNMT	593	Overall, there are a number of one-off and technical disruptions to this data, such as teachers returning from strikes, corrections to survey statistics, updates to the seasonal adjustment factor, which may be corrected in the future (reference: January 2022 increase in non-farmers from 5.04 million to 36.4 million), or nonfarm employment is not as strong as the data shows).	187	208	major
zh-en	KUNMT	594	Structurally, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies remains, but at a low level; new jobs in highly exposed services such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare have recovered significantly, and data show that the labor gap in the services sector remains.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	KUNMT	604	In the context of tight labour market supply and demand and the uncertain impact of austerity policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and that extreme market expectations of adjustment and trade congestion will cause some damage to the market.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	KUNMT	872	Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorder and exacerbate its consequences. Research in high-income countries has confirmed this, and in these studies, an individual's socioeconomic trajectory is not only related to their condition at a given point in time, but also to a drug-use risk.	324 331	330 334	major major

zh-en	KUNMT	880	However, alcohol seems to play a greater role than drugs in violent incidents.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	KUNMT	881	Although drug use can lead to crime, in some cases this link can be partially attributed to a number of intermediate factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment and peer influence.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	KUNMT	986	-fexternal-templates generates smaller code for template declarations (only limited to C++), the method is to generate a copy for each template function only where they are defined.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	KUNMT	987	To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementatio' ((definition) or „Çô#Pragm interface' (statement) in all files that use the template.	80	90	major
zh-en	KUNMT	988	When a program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', the template instantiation is all of an external type. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	KUNMT	989	This can be done with typedef, which he cites for every instance needed.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	KUNMT	990	Correspondingly, if the default option ` -fno-exteznal-templates' is used when compiling, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.	48	68	major
zh-en	KUNMT	991	All member functions (except the constructor subfunction and the mnew or delete member operator) are considered to be false functions of their class.	108	121	major
zh-en	KUNMT	992	This does not mean that every time a member function is called, it will pass through the internal virtual function table.	-1	-1	no-error

zh-en	KUNMT	994	-fcond-mismatch Allows type mismatches of the second and third parameters of a conditional expression.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	KUNMT	995	The value of this expression is the Void.-fthis- is-variable which allows the assignment of a value to this (only for c++).	47	52	minor
zh-en	KUNMT	996	The incorporation of user-customized free storage management mechanisms into C++ makes the value-assignable 'this' seem unfashionable.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	KUNMT	997	Therefore, by default, the assignment of this to the class member function is invalid.	33	51	minor

zh-en	KUNMT	1000	Each machine has its own default char type. It can be either unsigned char or signed char.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	KUNMT	1001	Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on data symbolicity.	84	89	major
zh-en	KUNMT	1002	However, many programs have been written using only the simple char, and this is either symbolic (or non-symbolic, depending on the target machine that is writing the program).	88	95	major
zh-en	KUNMT	1003	This option, and its counter-options, allows that program to work at the corresponding default value.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	KUNMT	1004	The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly the same as one of them.	-1	-1	no-error
zh-en	KUNMT	1005	If the modifier ` signed' or 'unsigned' is not explicitly stated, these options are used to define a bitfield or a non-symbol field.	109	123	major
zh-en	KUNMT	1006	By default, bytes are symbolic because they inherit a basic integer type, such as int, which is symbolical, however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, the byte is always unsymbolic.	9 106	15 111	major major
zh-en	KUNMT	1007	-fwritable-strings stores string constants to writable data segments without special treatment.	-1	-1	no-error
