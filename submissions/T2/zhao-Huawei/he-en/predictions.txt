he-en	CNN-NER	480	The Drug Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and our health. Each year, the committee decides on new drugs to be given to the public free of charge through health insurance funds but a new state inspector's report released today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without audit reports and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council overseeing and examining its activities.	4 238	15 253	minor minor
he-en	CNN-NER	481	Israel Today columnist Ren Resnick adds that the State Auditor's investigation was conducted in the wake of the ongoing exposures in "Israel Today" of drug cart manufacturers.	55 156	62 160	minor major
he-en	CNN-NER	482	According to the report by Methanjo Angelmann, he recommends "to make corrections and improvements in the basket expansion process, which will lead to a more qualitative extraction of the healthcare basket budget to which the public is entitled". Throughout the years that the mechanism has been in existence, eight billion shekels of drugs were added into the state budget in 2021-1998, with the surplus moving annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million.	24 324 27	41 330 45	major major major
he-en	CNN-NER	483	In 2019, 2020 and 2021, requests were made to add about 800 new medicines and technologies to the health services basket, at a total annual cost of more than NIS two billion. In practice, the budget allocated for the expansion of the basket was less than the scope of applications.	-1	-1	no-error
he-en	CNN-NER	484	The critic notes that the amount of the annual surcharge needs to be reviewed and adjusted in order to allow for certainty and long-term planning. Angelman also noted that "the transparency model in basketball work is lacking". For example, the basketball committee's working procedure stipulates that minutes of meetings, which are closed to the public, be published within 60 days, but in practice minutes are published 160-109 days late, with sometimes final meeting minutes not published at all.	-1	-1	no-error
he-en	CNN-NER	485	The delay in the publication of protocols impairs the transparency of decisions; as a result, it may impair the ability of proposers  hospital organizations and pharmaceutical companies to reapply as soon as possible and appropriately, after they have learned from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for the failure of the previous round, improved and corrected their proposal, and re-evaluated their readiness to accept it in a subsequent round, the reviewer noted in his report.	123 154	154 159	major minor
he-en	CNN-NER	486	Of the thousands of submissions, only one financial comment was submitted.	-1	-1	no-error
he-en	CNN-NER	487	Another criticism of Angelman concerns a preliminary procedure for evaluating technologies submitted to the drug basket. The reviewer found that half (46%) of the submitted technologies did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection.	-1	-1	no-error
he-en	CNN-NER	488	Another deficiency concerns the activity of the Subcommittee on the Medicine Basket, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed. The reviewer recommends that a public representative be included or that the discussions be made public without confidential commercial details.	48 68 77	60 76 83	minor minor major
he-en	CNN-NER	489	For example, requests to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket for the 2021-2019 discussions of the Basket Committee were made. The report found that the applications were not accompanied by economic estimates, including an estimate of how much could have been saved by reducing the harm of diseases caused by obesity or by being able to avoid gastric bypass surgery.	80 99	90 115	minor minor
he-en	CNN-NER	490	It also arises that the decisions of the drug basket committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of Ministry of Health. For example, in 2019, the ministry of health defined cancer prevention and preparation medicine for the treatment of chronic diseases as targets, but the decision on the expansion of basket did not emphasize the need to achieve these goals.	205	225	minor
he-en	CNN-NER	491	The reviewer also warns that since 2011 the medicine basket also includes non-hospital insurance services, including various rehabilitation and mobility devices and vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health ("Third Supplement"). This is when the legal framework for this step is regulated only in retrospect. In the last six years, NIS 74 million from the supplement to the drug basket has been used for these services.	377	381	minor
he-en	CNN-NER	492	Angelmann recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket working procedures and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services. About one-third of the new drugs entering the medicine basket are designated as "no-cost drugs", the use of which does not cost patients an additional amount because they replace existing treatment. The reviewer suggests examining the possibility of these drugs being prescribed in a different and shortened route so that prescriptions can be updated several times a year rather than just once per year.	-1	-1	no-error
he-en	CNN-NER	493	There's no control over the use of very expensive drugs.	-1	-1	no-error
he-en	CNN-NER	494	The criticism also shows that since the work of the Basket Committee began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked hospitals to report nor supervised the extent of use and utilization of drugs in the basket, information that could have enabled the ministry to analyze and audit the budget given to the funds. Over the years only two reports relating to 2009-2006 have been published.	-1	-1	no-error
he-en	CNN-NER	495	Delays in testing may lead to difficulties in data collection and analysis, irrelevance of conclusions after such a long time, subcommittee bias and decisions based on incomplete findings, the report said.	-1	-1	no-error
he-en	CNN-NER	496	Also, the Ministry does not monitor and supervise the use of particularly expensive medicines and has not produced samples. These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in 2021-2016). Regarding this, a reviewer wrote: "It is recommended that the Health Ministry carry out individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the scope of their use against estimates.	197	200	minor

he-en	CNN-NER	584	First, the T.A. came in with a radical change in his offensive and passing habits.

Wisdom is to continue to play drill and dedication movement precisely at the moment of the clash, which must go into Teddy and team DNA.	114 225 269 273 315 413 139 149 345 432	154 230 272 287 411 450 144 154 350 437	major major major major major major major major major major
